# WASM spike — does the core actually live under Emscripten?

**Verdict: yes, and bit-exactly.** The `wasm-audio` tier that felitronics-core's [`DSP-ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/darwinscat/felitronics-core/blob/main/docs/DSP-ARCHITECTURE.md) §2
declares is real, not aspirational: `analysis` + `oversampling` compile under Emscripten with
`-fno-exceptions -fno-rtti` and no pthreads, run in a browser with no COOP/COEP headers, and produce
**bit-identical doubles** to the native reference — provided one compiler flag is set, which is the whole
substance of this document.

The spike exists because *"it compiled and linked"* is not evidence. The precedent that motivated it: in a
sibling project libsoxr compiled and linked cheaply under Emscripten and then **crashed at runtime**,
discovered only after the build.

**Toolchain, recorded explicitly.** emsdk **6.0.9**, emscripten commit
`4e4223852a0835923411059a3929907d7df1232e`, bundled node 24.19.0. Native reference: Apple clang 21.0.0
(arm64 macOS) and gcc 14.2.0 (x86-64 Debian 13). Reproduce with `tools/wasm/build.sh`.

## What was built

| | |
|---|---|
| `tools/fcore_probe.h` | `fcore::Probe` — the measurement body, shared **verbatim** by the native CLI and the wasm shim. Chunks internally at 8192 frames, so a whole-file buffer costs the same bounded scratch as a stream. |
| `tools/fcore_measure.cpp` | The native reference, refactored onto `Probe`. New `blocks` mode; `--precise`. |
| `tools/wasm/fc_probe.cpp` | The C ABI: planar-contiguous, one pointer, channel `c` at `planar + c*frames`. |
| `tools/wasm/build.sh` | Three artifacts — `web` (the specified one), `node` (harness), `debug` (SAFE_HEAP + assertions). |
| `tools/wasm/parity.mjs` | The wasm side of the parity check; emits exactly what the CLI emits, so `diff` **is** the test. |
| `tools/wasm/probe.html` | The page. Deliberately ugly. |

## What is compared, and why it is not the obvious thing

The naive acceptance test — "the LUFS from wasm matches the native LUFS to 1e-9" — **cannot be sound**, and
it took building the thing to see why.

Integrated LUFS is **discontinuous in its own inputs**. BS.1770 gating is a pair of strict comparisons
(`LoudnessMeter.h`, the absolute gate at −70 LUFS then the −10 LU relative gate). A 400 ms block sitting
within ~1e-12 of a threshold flips its inclusion between two builds and moves the answer by ~**0.01 dB** —
seven orders above any tolerance worth writing down. No scalar tolerance on a gated quantity is a robust
equivalence measure; it merely happens to pass.

So the comparison surface is the **pre-gate 400 ms block-energy vector**, newly exposed as
`analysis::LoudnessMeter::gatingBlockEnergies()`, plus the true-peak **linear** maximum. Both are continuous
in the input samples and can carry a bit-exactness claim. The scalar LUFS and dBTP remain, for humans.

This turned out to be far more than a principled nicety — see the negative control below. **The vector is
roughly three thousand times more sensitive than the scalar it replaced.**

---

## Acceptance

### 1. Bit-exactness — native vs wasm

| file | rate / ch | block energies | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `click120` | 44.1 kHz mono | 137 | **bit-identical** |
| `gr-clip` | 48 kHz stereo | 247 | **bit-identical** |
| `cold-gaze` | 48 kHz stereo | 3213 | **bit-identical** |

3597 doubles plus three true-peak maxima, every bit equal, native arm64 vs wasm32.

### 2. Size

| file | raw | gzip | brotli |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fcprobe.web.wasm` | 30 677 | 16 360 | **14 585** |
| `fcprobe.web.js` | 8 719 | 3 092 | 2 788 |

The two release `.wasm` (web glue and node glue) are **byte-identical** — `-sENVIRONMENT` shapes JS, not
code — which is what lets a parity result proven under node transfer to the browser.

### 3. No COOP/COEP, and no threads

Verified in a real browser against `python3 -m http.server`, which sends no isolation headers:
`crossOriginIsolated === false` and `SharedArrayBuffer === undefined` — threads are not merely unused, they
are **unavailable**, and the module works anyway. Its printed output was bit-identical to the native CLI.

Stronger and cheaper than the page test, and now part of `build.sh` via `check-no-threads.mjs`, which parses
the wasm memory section directly rather than shelling out to a `wasm-objdump` most machines do not have:

```
memories declared: 1
  min 258 pages (16.1 MiB), max 32768 pages (2048.0 MiB), shared=false
glue mentions SharedArrayBuffer / pthread / new Worker / Atomics.   0 times each
```

### 4. `-fno-exceptions` clean

Clean **for the spike**, which does not include `core/Fft.h`. It will not be clean for a CI gate over the
whole `analysis` module — see the findings.

### 5. Rate sweep — attached as evidence, deliberately not a gate

Bit-exactness was measured at 44.1 / 48 / 88.2 / 96 / 176.4 / 192 kHz. Two of those rates do **not** match.
That is a property of the libms involved rather than of this build, so it feeds the determinism question
below instead of failing the spike.

---

## The load-bearing flag: `-ffp-contract=off`

Baseline WASM has **no scalar FMA instruction**, so Emscripten cannot contract `a*b+c`. A native build that
does contract computes different doubles. This is not a tolerance question; it is a different computation.

**Negative control.** The same native tool, same source, built with contraction (the compiler default):

| file | block lines differing from wasm |
|---|---|
| `click120` | **137 of 137** |
| `gr-clip` | **248 of 248** |
| `cold-gaze` | **3188 of 3213** |

Nearly every block. The scalar LUFS hides this entirely — it averages the difference down to ~7e-15 dB — which
is precisely why the criterion moved onto the vector.

**The flag is architecture-sensitive, and that is a trap.** On arm64 `fmadd` is in the baseline ISA, so clang
contracts by default and the parity check fails immediately. On baseline x86-64 there is no FMA instruction,
so gcc *cannot* contract even at its `-ffp-contract=fast` default — parity passes **by accident**. Add
`-march=native` on the same x86 machine and gcc emits 20 FMA instructions and every line differs again.

> A CI job on default-flags x86-64 would therefore **never catch** the flag going missing, while the
> developer's own arm64 Mac fails instantly. The flag is set explicitly in `tools/CMakeLists.txt`, and
> `felitronics_probe_tests` asserts it actually took effect: dropping it turns a silent parity failure into a
> red test.

## Cross-tier determinism: the outlier is Apple's libm, not wasm

Bit-exactness holds at the rates the corpus uses — and **not** everywhere:

| rate | native arm64 (clang) vs wasm | native x86-64 (gcc) vs wasm |
|---|---|---|
| 44.1 kHz | identical | identical |
| 48 kHz | identical | identical |
| **88.2 kHz** | **395 of 397 blocks differ** | **identical** |
| 96 kHz | identical | — |
| 176.4 kHz | identical | — |
| **192 kHz** | **396 of 397 blocks differ** | — |

The true-peak line is identical at all six rates — the oversampler's prototype is designed from the
oversampling factor alone and never sees the sample rate. Everything above is the loudness path.

The cause is `analysis::KWeightingFilter::computeCoeffs`, which designs the BS.1770 coefficients with
`std::tan` and `std::pow` in `double`. Measured against a 300-bit reference, the shelf stage's
`tan(pi*1681.974/fs)` on Apple's libm is:

| rate | 44.1 k | 48 k | 88.2 k | 96 k | 176.4 k | 192 k |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| error vs correctly rounded | +0.61 ulp | **−0.03** | +0.66 | +0.82 | −0.68 | **−1.07** |
| bit-identical to CR? | no | **yes** | no | no | no | no |

So Apple's libm is the outlier at **five of six** rates, and at 192 kHz its error exceeds one ulp — it is not
even faithfully rounded there. musl (what Emscripten compiles in) and glibc both return the correctly rounded
value at all six. The second-stage `tan(pi*38.135/fs)` agrees everywhere.

Only two of those five survive into the coefficients: at 88.2 kHz the shelf's `b0`/`b2` flip and at 192 kHz
`a2` does, and a changed coefficient changes the filter for *every* sample — hence nearly every block rather
than one. At 44.1, 96 and 176.4 kHz the 1-ulp difference is absorbed by the coefficient arithmetic. **48 kHz
is not absorption at all** — Apple's `tan` simply happens to be correctly rounded at that one argument.

The three-way comparison is what makes this actionable: **x86-64 Linux/gcc agrees with wasm at 88.2 kHz while
arm64 macOS does not.** The divergence lives on the development machine, and a Linux CI job would never see
it.

Magnitude, so the risk is not overstated. Over the 397-block sweep fixture, the largest single-block
divergence is **2.8e-13 dB at 88.2 kHz** and **1.2e-12 dB at 192 kHz** (6.4e-14 and 2.7e-13 relative in
energy). A *tolerance* criterion at 1e-9 dB would therefore pass at all six rates with three orders of margin;
**bit-identity passes at four, and at three of those four only by luck.** That is the whole argument for
treating the rate question as an open determinism contract rather than a pass/fail gate: the numbers are
fine, the guarantee is not.

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

- 44.1, 96 and 176.4 kHz pass **by rounding absorption, not by construction**, and 48 kHz by a coincidence of
  one argument. Any libm update on either side could end either. 96 kHz is heavily used, so this is not an
  exotic corner.
- The core has no stated cross-platform determinism contract. It needs one before any facade can promise
  "bit-identical output" across tiers. The cheap route is to remove libm from the compared path entirely —
  the coefficients are designed from two transcendentals at a handful of standard rates.

## Emscripten gotchas found

1. **Exports are opt-in.** In 6.x, `Module._malloc`, `Module._free` and the `HEAP*` views are `undefined`
   unless named in `-sEXPORTED_FUNCTIONS` / `-sEXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS`. The page dies on first use.
2. **Memory grows *inside* the C call.** With `ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH`, `memory.grow` replaces the underlying
   `ArrayBuffer` and **detaches every existing view**: writes are silently dropped, reads come back
   undefined. It is not enough to re-read the heap after `_malloc` — the meter's own ~1.27 MB `prepare()`
   can cross a growth boundary during the call. Never hold a `HEAP*` view or a `subarray` across any exported
   call; return results by value.
3. **Never `-mrelaxed-simd` on anything checked by a null test.** It lets LLVM emit `f64x2.relaxed_madd`,
   which is implementation-defined — fused on hosts with FMA, unfused elsewhere. That breaks determinism
   between *machines*, not merely between tiers. Plain `-msimd128` lowers to `f64x2.mul/add` and is safe.
4. **`long double` is 16 bytes on wasm32** (IEEE quad, software) against 8 on arm64 macOS and 80-bit x87 on
   x86-64 Linux — three tiers, three answers.
5. **`>>> 2`, never `>> 2`,** when converting a pointer to a `HEAPF32` index: above 2 GB a signed shift goes
   negative.
6. **A checked build is not optional.** `-O1 -g -sASSERTIONS=2 -sSAFE_HEAP=1 -sSTACK_OVERFLOW_CHECK=2` runs
   clean and bit-identical to release. That, not the release build working, is what rules out the libsoxr
   failure mode.

Non-problems, checked and dismissed: `LoudnessMeter::prepare(fs, nc, 4 h)` allocates **1 269 696 bytes**, not
a heap threat; 64-byte `align_val_t` allocation works under emmalloc; the 64 KB default stack is ample.

## Fixed here, because the spike's reference tool cannot be knowingly wrong

The post-build review found that **the reference tool was under-reporting true peak on any file
that ends on a transient**, and had been doing so since it was written. The polyphase oversampler is causal
with a group delay of 63.5 oversampled samples, so the reconstruction of the final ~16 baseband samples never
left the filter while input was still arriving. Measured, before the fix:

| signal | reported | truth |
|---|---|---|
| unit impulse in the last sample | 0.000071 | 0.881 |
| last ten samples at 0.95, abrupt end | 0.0152 (**−36 dBTP**) | 1.0625 (**+0.53 dBTP** — over full scale) |

A true-peak tool that reports −36 dBTP for a clipping ending is worse than no tool, and both tiers would have
agreed on it bit-exactly. Two fixes, both in `fcore::Probe`:

- **`finish()`** drains the FIR with `kOsTapsPerPhase` silent samples (the oversampler only — feeding the
  loudness meter would append program that was never submitted). Idempotent; ends the stream.
- **the sample peak is a hard floor** under the true peak. The reconstruction passes through the samples by
  construction, so `truePeak >= samplePeak` always. On its own the floor recovers most of the error above
  (0.0152 → 0.95); `finish()` supplies the inter-sample part the floor cannot know about.

A third defect, found in the same review and introduced by the fix above: `truePeakDb()` was computed from
the oversampler maximum while `truePeakLinear()` applied the new floor, so the tool's dB and linear answers
disagreed on exactly the signals the floor exists for. Both now derive from one value.

Also hardened while there, all of it facing input a page computes: the sample rate is bounded to
1 kHz … 768 kHz (8 kHz … 768 kHz since the core's sample-rate floor — 1 kHz sat inside the band where K-weighting is unstable)
(positive-and-finite is not enough — `lround(0.01*fs)` on 1e300 is out of range, and a page
can pass `Number.MIN_VALUE` as easily as 48000), `maxDurationSec` is validated, a non-positive channel count
is refused rather than silently recording invented silent blocks, and the C ABI checks that the span it was
handed lies inside the wasm heap instead of trapping on a pointer near the top of linear memory.

## Findings for the core (not fixed here — this is a spike)

- **`analysis::KWeightingFilter` violates portability law 8.** It is the only feedback kernel in the core with
  no software denormal flush. After 2.96 s of digital silence its state reaches the subnormal range and then
  **sticks permanently** — measured out to 600 s, frozen at `-1.240105e-321`. On x86 without hardware FTZ,
  which is what a browser gives, **processing silence then costs 51× more than processing music**
  (22.62 ms vs 0.44 ms per 2 s, i9-13900H). Invisible on Apple Silicon, which handles subnormals at full
  speed — which is why it survived this long.
- **One `throw` blocks the `-fno-exceptions` CI gate.** `core/Fft.h`'s `SeamAllocator::allocate` is the only
  one in `core` + `analysis` + `oversampling`. The spike does not include that header; a gate over the whole
  `analysis` module will, through the three spectrum panes.
- **The core holds two different true-peak filters.** This tool's path (`PolyphaseOversampler` at 4×, 32
  taps/phase, cutoff 0.90× Nyquist, Kaiser β9) and `analysis::TruePeakMeter` (48 taps, full base Nyquist, β8,
  factor by rate). They agree to 0.0009–0.0028 dB on music, and to ~0.07 dB on a 12 kHz sine phased to miss
  the sample crests — the one fixture where the *designs* actually diverge. (An earlier ~1.1 dB figure on
  impulses was this tool's missing sample-peak floor, not a filter difference; with the floor both land on the
  sample peak and agree exactly.) Which design is spec-correct stays **unresolved, and ffmpeg does not
  arbitrate**: on that 12 kHz fixture `ebur128` reports −0.3 dBTP while ours report −0.81 and −0.88, so both
  4× paths under-read it by about half a dB. That is a question about oversampling factor, not about which
  prototype is right.
  *(Later: those figures are this spike's, on its fixtures. The gap on DELIVERED masters, at every delivery
  rate, is pinned by `felitronics_truepeak_instrument_gap_tests`; the probe's filter now lives in
  `analysis::ReferenceTruePeakMeter`, which `TargetLoudnessSolver` aims with.)*
- **A single non-finite sample silently freezes the loudness.** The two paths fail differently, and only one
  of them recovers. The true peak is blind for 32 samples while the NaN sits in the polyphase ring
  (`std::max(x, NaN)` returns `x`) and then works again — feed it louder audio afterwards and it duly rises.
  K-weighting is an IIR, so its state is NaN *forever*: every later block energy is NaN, `NaN > absT` is
  false, and the absolute gate silently drops all of them. The meter then goes on reporting a healthy number
  computed over the fraction of the program that predates the NaN, and `droppedBlocks()` says nothing.
  Pinned by `felitronics_probe_tests`.
