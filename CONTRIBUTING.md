# Contributing to felitronics-mastering-core

**Short version: issues yes, code no.**

## Bug reports, questions and ideas — welcome

Open an issue. "The loudness search lands 0.3 LU off on a quiet intro", a question about an API, a
suggestion for a module — all of these are genuinely useful and get acted on. If a fix or a
feature lands because you raised it, you are credited in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Code — not accepted

Pull requests containing code are closed unmerged, automatically, regardless of how good the
change is. This is a standing policy, not a verdict on your patch. Only the two authors merge into
`main`, and the repository enforces it: `main` changes only through a pull request merged by them.

**Why.** felitronics-mastering-core is AGPL-3.0-or-later and the copyright is held solely by its two
authors, Oleh Tsymaienko and Alisa Lafoks. A merged contribution leaves its author holding
copyright on those lines permanently. From that moment the project can no longer change its own
licensing terms — dual-licensing, granting an exception, shipping it inside something else —
without tracking down every past contributor and obtaining each one's agreement. Nobody can
foresee a decade of a project's life; declining code costs nothing today, so that is the side
we err on.

If your patch would have been genuinely good, **describe the change in an issue instead**.
Ideas are not copyrightable — only their expression is — so a well-described problem or approach
can be implemented here freely. You get the fix you wanted, with credit, and the project keeps
its options open.

Describe it in prose, though — **please do not paste code into the issue**. A pasted patch brings
the same copyright question in through the side door, and code that has been read cannot be
unread: someone who has seen your implementation can no longer write that part independently. The
problem, the approach and the behaviour you expect are what is useful here, and none of that needs
a diff.

## What this policy does NOT do

It takes away none of the freedoms the AGPL grants you. You may use this library, study it,
modify it, and distribute your own modified version under the same licence. Forking is expressly
fine. This is only about what gets merged *here*.

## Third-party code

This repository vendors no third-party code. felitronics-core, which it builds on, records its own in its
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. New third-party dependencies are not added without review.

The Felitronics and Darwin's Cat names and logos are trademarks and are *not* covered by the code
licence.
