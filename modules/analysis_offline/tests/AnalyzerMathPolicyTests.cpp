// The analyzers' half of the math-policy routing gate. felitronics-core's MathPolicyTests pins the other half
// — the shipped RT names bound to core::SystemMath, the deterministic spellings a DIFFERENT type, and a
// runtime witness that the two policies differ on the running row. What is left for here is ownership: the
// offline analyzers must stay on the DETERMINISTIC math. They are compared byte for byte across rows, and the
// system libm is not the same function on every row: at 44.1 kHz the filter arguments of ProgrammeReport
// (30 Hz), BandBursts (9 kHz) and the K-weighting corner (1681.97 Hz) all give different coefficients on
// Apple's libm than on glibc's and musl's — measured.
//
// The static_asserts make an alias change a deliberate act that must also edit this file.
