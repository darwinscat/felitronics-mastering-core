// analysis::LowEnd self-tests — the wide-bass and dominant-note instrument a lacquer asks for.
//
// WHAT IS NULLED AGAINST SOMETHING COMPUTED OUTSIDE THE OBJECT, which is the part that matters: a
// re-slicing test compares the implementation with ITSELF, so a schedule or a calibration that is
// deterministically wrong stays bit-identical across every slicing and passes green. This repository
// has already measured that (SpectrumFramesTests.cpp:31 — a frame trigger anchored to the wrong end
// survived all 14 slicings and took an outside witness to kill). So:
//   · THE LR4 ANALYTIC ORACLE. The settled side fraction of a "60 Hz mono bass + X Hz anti-phase tone"
//     fixture is predicted from the transfer function alone — |H_lp|^2 = 1/(1+r^4)^2 with the SVF's
//     PREWARPED r = tan(pi f/fs)/tan(pi fc/fs) — and compared with what the object measured, at
//     X = 120, 180, 240, 480 and 1000 Hz. The analogue-prototype r = f/fc is NOT this filter and is
//     visibly wrong here, so the oracle is a real second implementation, not a restatement.
//   · THE NEGATIVE TEST: a programme WIDE above the crossover and MONO below must not
//     read as wide bass. Its bar is the number above, 4.8e-8, not "about zero".
//   · ABSOLUTE SPECTRAL CALIBRATION. A full-scale sine inside one semitone band must read A^2/2 — its
//     own mean square. That one number pins the one-sided FOLD, the |X|^2/(N*sum w^2) normalisation and
//     the half-bin cell offset at once; a constant calibration error survives every self-comparison.
//   · A DIRECT O(N^2) DFT BAND NULL. One frame's band energy against a windowed DFT and an
//     independently written fractional-overlap integration.
//   · THE CENTROID against a tone detuned by a known number of cents.
//   · EXACT IMPULSE ARITHMETIC on a flat spectrum, where nothing is a measurement: frameEnergy() is
//     8/(3N) by Parseval, bandRangeShare() is the fraction of Nyquist the bands cover (1.1345 % at the
//     defaults), peakShare() is the widest band's width over the range's, and the grid's own tilt is
//     10*log10(2^(20/12)) = 5.0172 dB — all closed forms, none of them read off the implementation.
//   · THE EXACT HISTOGRAM CONTENTS on a 121-sample fixture: bin 50 holds 121 SAMPLES, which is what
//     separates duration-weighting from one-count-per-block (2) and from a full-weighted partial (240).
//   · THE CROSSOVER'S EDGE: |H|^2 = 1/4 in each branch at fc, so low + high is HALF the input power,
//     which is the LR4 allpass caveat stated as a number rather than a warning.
//
// LAW 8a — bit-identical under ARBITRARY re-slicing (stronger than law 11(a)'s same-boundaries promise).
// Compared BIT-EXACTLY with std::bit_cast, field by field, never memcmp (padding) and never != (which
// cannot tell -0.0 from +0.0) — the form of WaveformShapeTests.cpp:163:
//   · the whole TRACE, filled when a block CLOSES and when a frame is CONSUMED, not at the exit of
//     process(): coordinates, validity, hole counts and the RAW linear energies and per-frame band
//     powers, before any ratio, log or reduction;
//   · AND the whole final REPORT, field by field, because a trace does not cover the integrals, the
//     histogram, the extrema, the median or the centroid — and a defect in those cancels in a maximum,
//     a percentile or a rounding (docs/LAW8-KWEIGHTING.md:78: identical LUFS and dBTP over 5 changed
//     block energies out of 97);
//   · over 16 slicings — whole, 1, 2, 3, prime, B-1, B, B+1, H-1, H, H+1, W-1, W, W+1, larger than any
//     maxBlock, and seeded ragged partitions — with call boundaries landing deliberately on a hop, a
//     window end, a StateGrid tick (64) and a block edge; and across three prepared maxBlock values.
//
// MUTANT PASS — run once, not asserted, and recorded here because a gate that has never been red is not
// a gate. (Run on the suite's geometry from before the rate floor, 6 kHz / order 14; see kFs for the move to 12 kHz.)
// Each mutant was built with the object file DELETED first: a header edited in the same SECOND
// as the previous build is invisible to make's 1-second mtime granularity, and the stand refuses a
// verdict unless a `Building CXX` line appeared (this cost three false greens elsewhere today).
//   ( 1) frame consumed at the end of process() instead of on the sample that closed it -> RED, 34 of 492
//   ( 2) denormal flush moved to the end of process() instead of the StateGrid boundary  -> RED, 11 of 492
//   ( 3) the one-sided FOLD dropped (interior bins weighted 1 instead of 2)              -> RED, 15 of 492
//   ( 4) the half-bin cell offset dropped ([k,k+1) cells, not [k-1/2,k+1/2))             -> RED, 22 of 492
//   ( 5) the first moment taken at the BIN CENTRE instead of the overlap midpoint        -> RED,  9 of 492
//   ( 6) filter-then-encode instead of encode-then-filter                                -> RED,  2 of 492
//   ( 7) extrema ties broken by the LATEST block (> becomes >=)                          -> RED,  3 of 492
//   ( 8) the background median taken over ENERGIES instead of densities                  -> RED,  2 of 492
//   ( 9) the partial final block claims a FULL block length                              -> RED,  9 of 492
//   (10) Mid analysed alone, the Side axis dropped from the note spectrum                -> RED,  3 of 492
//   (11) the round-off floor removed, so `> 0` alone names a note again                  -> RED,  6 of 492
//   (12) the frame's own energy not folded, so bandRangeShare is off by ~2               -> RED,  2 of 492
//   (13) the partial final block excluded from the histogram instead of weighted         -> RED,  1 of 492
//   (14) the range share taken against the RAW time energy, not the frame's              -> RED,  1 of 492
// THREE OF THESE SURVIVED THE FIRST PASS, and the holes they exposed are why three sections exist:
// (5) was green because the only cents assertions sat on a 13-bin-wide band where the edge cells carry
// almost nothing — the DFT null now nulls the first MOMENT too, at a band 1.2 bins wide; (6) was green
// because exact mono gives a bit-exact zero either way, so the discriminator had to be a NEAR-mono
// fixture (one sample, one ulp); (8) was green because the white-noise section proved the densities are
// flat without ever checking that backgroundDensity() is the median OF them, which an independent
// median now does. A gate that has never been red is not a gate, and three of these were not.
// Mutants (3), (4), (5), (8) and (10) are invisible to the re-slicing comparison BY CONSTRUCTION: they
// are deterministically wrong under every slicing, so all 16 partitions agree with each other and stay
// green. Every one of them is killed by an oracle computed outside the object, and by nothing else.
