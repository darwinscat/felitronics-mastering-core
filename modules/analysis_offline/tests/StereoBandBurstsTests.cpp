// Band bursts on Mid and Side, and the cross-reading that says which one carried the burst.
//
// THE ORACLE IS THE SCALED-COPY THEOREM, not a second detector. If R = k·L then M = (1+k)/2·L and
// S = (1−k)/2·L: BOTH axes are scaled copies of the same signal, so a detector that judges a hop against
// its OWN baseline must fire identically on both, at the same hops, whatever k is — while the cross
// reading between them must be exactly ((1+k)/(1−k))² in power. One fixture therefore pins the event
// logic (counts and positions must MATCH) and the cross arithmetic (a number that must DIFFER by a
// closed form) at the same time, and neither number is one this file measured and wrote down.
