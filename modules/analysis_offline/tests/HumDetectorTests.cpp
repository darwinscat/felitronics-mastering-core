// HumDetector self-tests — mains hum against the notes that look like it, and law 8a over the whole report.
//
//   · GEOMETRY pinned by HAND-COMPUTED numbers, not by the function the object sizes itself with: an auto
//     order of 17 at 48 kHz / 18 at 96 kHz / 15 at 12 kHz, and every derived bin extent at the test rate
//   · the MONOTONE-SKIRT oracle: a direct double DFT of a Hann-windowed 49.0 Hz tone, computed outside the
//     object, showing the sampled skirt has NO interior local maximum — which is what lets the detector
//     enumerate every local maximum without reading a note's sidelobe as a 50 Hz line
//   · POSITION accuracy against the frequency that was synthesised: 0.02 bins over a sub-bin sweep
//   · the NEGATIVE notes, G1 = 49.0 / A#1 = 58.3 / B1 = 61.7 Hz, sustained through two quiet stretches
//   · HUM UNDER A LOUDER NOTE — the case that fails if only the strongest peak of the window is examined
//   · 100/120 Hz with NO fundamental: base 2, `fundamentalObserved == false`, the fundamental marked derived
//   · a MOVING tone, both between stretches and inside them (two sweeps whose averages agree)
//   · the validity ladder: NotPrepared / NotFinished / InsufficientResolution / ShorterThanWindow /
//     AllFramesHoled / NoQuietStretch / SingleQuietStretch — a false "clean" is the one forbidden answer
//   · law 8a: the FULL frame trace, every accumulated band bin, every report/candidate/harmonic/stretch field,
//     compared BIT-EXACTLY by std::bit_cast across 14 slicings, seeded ragged partitions, and two maxBlocks
//   · capacity as DATA: maxStretches 1 against 64 classifies identically; the trace overflows the same way
//   · lifecycle: finish idempotent, process refused after it, reset replays bit-identically, no allocation
//
// MUTANT PASS — run, results recorded. 34 of 35 red; six of them were GREEN on an earlier pass and every
// one of those greens was a hole in the SUITE, which is what sections 10b-10k exist for. Each mutant was

// appeared: a header edited in the same SECOND as the previous build is invisible to make's one-second

// WHY (21) IS AN EQUIVALENCE AND NOT A HOLE, measured rather than argued. Averaging frames raises a line and
// its background together, so the peak-to-floor RATIO barely improves with frame count — averaging buys the
// stability of the estimate and the accuracy of its position, not sensitivity (sensitivity comes from a
// longer WINDOW, which narrows the bin and so lowers the per-bin background while the line keeps its power).
// The consequence is that stretch observations and frame observations appear and disappear together: swept
// from amplitude 1.2e-3 down to 8e-5, at 3 frames per stretch and again at 16, the two counts crossed at the
// same step every time, and the frame spread was WIDER than the stretch spread in every row (0.58 vs 0.57 at
// 3 frames, 0.67 vs 0.57 at 16). So no input reached makes the stretch-spread gate the deciding one. It is
// kept because it is the gate that states the requirement on the ROBUST estimate, and because the
// redundancy is an empirical property of these parameters rather than a theorem.
//
// A SEVENTH mutant came back green and was NOT a hole: deleting the gap check on consecutive selected frame
// indices changed nothing, because every closed frame reaches onFrame() and every path but "quiet and
// finite" has already closed the stretch. That check could not fire, so it was deleted from the header
// rather than kept as a gate that cannot redden.
// Mutant (2) is this instrument's stand-in for "the denormal flush moved to the call boundary": HumDetector
// holds no IIR state and no per-sample recurrence, so core::StateGrid has nothing to schedule here, and the
// state a call boundary could corrupt is the open stretch.
