//==============================================================================
// felitronics::analysis::SpectrumFrames — the shared FRAME PRODUCER the offline analyzers measure on.
// It is deliberately NOT a "long-term spectrum": it produces one calibrated power spectrum per WINDOW,
// on an absolute schedule, and the consumer decides what to do with each frame — average them all
// (SourceForensics), keep only the ones inside a quiet stretch (HumDetector), or fold a band of bins
// into semitones (LowEnd). An averaging primitive would fit the first and fit the other two not at all.
//
// WHY THIS IS SHARED AND THE AVERAGING IS NOT. Every known way a windowed analyzer silently stops being
// re-blocking-invariant lives in this layer, not above it: one FFT per process() call over "whatever
// arrived"; a frame trigger anchored to the frame START (`pos % hop == 0` fires at pos == hop, on a
// frame that does not exist yet, and never agrees with the end-anchored rule when N % hop != 0); a
// "samples since the last frame" counter that some path resets; zero-padding the tail inside the last
// process(), where "last" is unknowable; reducing the two physical halves of a wrapped ring separately;
// windowing a reused buffer twice. One implementation, tested once, spends that risk once.
//
// THE CONTRACT (law 8a — bit-identical under ARBITRARY re-slicing, which is stronger than law 11(a)'s
// same-boundaries promise):
//   * One integer clock. `totalSamples_` counts samples CONSUMED since reset(). push() writes one
//     channel's sample at the current time; tick() closes the sample and advances the clock once.
//   * Frame f covers exactly [f*hop, f*hop + N) and is emitted the instant sample f*hop + N - 1 has
//     been consumed — i.e. when `totalSamples_ >= N && (totalSamples_ - N) % hop == 0`. The trigger
//     reads the clock and nothing else, so no call boundary can move it.
//   * maxBlock sizes NOTHING here. A report must be identical for prepare(sr, 64, nch) and
//     prepare(sr, 8192, nch).
//   * THE TAIL IS NOT TRANSFORMED. finish() emits no extra frame; it publishes
//     tailUncoveredSamples() instead. A zero-padded frame is a DIFFERENT measurement (truncated window,
//     power scaled by (N-m)/N, plus leakage off the discontinuity), and a right-aligned tail frame
//     overlaps its predecessor and over-weights the end of the programme in any average. A programme
//     shorter than N produces no frame at all — that is `valid = false, ShorterThanWindow` upstairs,
//     never a zero that reads as "nothing found".
//   * A frame containing ANY hole (a non-finite sample, or a channel absent from that call) is emitted
//     with frameFinite(c) == false and is NOT transformed: holes are counted, never guessed.
//
// PRECISION. The transform is core::offline::fftInplace — double, in place, noexcept, and it does NOT
// allocate (the "ALLOCATES" banner on that header is about its convolve/magSpectrum wrappers). The
// scratch is owned by prepare(). Double, not the float core::fft seam, for three reasons: the float
// seam's backend concept has no allocation query, so an honest Storage/law-11d budget cannot include
// it; it carries a template parameter five analyzers would have to agree on; and its pffft ON/OFF CI
// rows transform to different bits. A 2^17 frame costs ~11 Mflop, i.e. a second or two for a
// five-minute programme — this runs once per file.
//
// CALIBRATION. power(c)[k] = |X_k|^2 / (N * sum(w^2)), one-sided is NOT folded (bin k is bin k), so a
// band share is dimensionless and comparable with a time-domain energy ratio. Both window gains are
// published FROM THE WINDOW AS BUILT rather than from a textbook constant: windowPowerGain() = sum(w^2)/N
// (Parseval) and windowCoherentGain() = sum(w)/N (= 0.5 for Hann; a sinusoid's amplitude).
//
// RT: this is an OFFLINE instrument (message thread). prepare() allocates; push/tick/finish do not.
