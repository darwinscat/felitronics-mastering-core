//==============================================================================
// felitronics::analysis::HumDetector — MAINS HUM: a narrow, STATIONARY line at 50 or 60 Hz with a comb of exact
// multiples, looked for only where the programme is QUIET, because music masks it.
//
// WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED. The report carries coordinates and continuous evidence: where the
// line sits (in Hz, interpolated inside the bin), how far it stands above the LOCAL background (in dB), which
// harmonics were seen, and which stretches of the programme were used (in samples). `mains` says a
// MAINS-COMPATIBLE STATIONARY LINE was measured at that nominal — it is not a causal claim about electricity.
// A synthesised 50.000 Hz pedal with exact harmonics can be sample-for-sample what an interference pickup
// leaves, and no audio-only instrument separates the two; ClipDetector states the same limit for a hard-driven
// clamp against a square wave ("one PCM, two histories", ClipDetector.h:62). What the instrument CAN do is
// refuse to guess, and say why.
//
// THE FIVE THINGS THAT SEPARATE HUM FROM A BASS NOTE — and the hostile notes are close: G1 = 49.0 Hz sits 1.0 Hz
// from 50, A#1 = 58.3 Hz and B1 = 61.7 Hz sit 1.7 Hz from 60.
//   1. HUM IS THERE IN THE QUIET. Frames are selected by their own loudness (below `quietThresholdDb`), so the
//      evidence comes from where the programme is not.
//   5. ...AND A LINE THAT STOPS WHERE THE PROGRAMME FALLS QUIET IS MUSIC (owner, 01.10). The gate of (1) leaves the
//      candidate bands out (below: a hum must not censor itself), so a passage where a loud 50 or 60 Hz line plays
//      over an otherwise quiet programme reads as quiet too — that is how a 60 Hz musical tone was reported as hum.
//      A mains line does not stop when the music does. So the frames where EVERYTHING is quiet — the candidate bands
//      included, under the same `quietThresholdDb` — are pooled apart ("still" frames), and a line that passed
//      every test above must also show in that pool wherever it holds `minFramesPerObservation` frames:
//      `valid = false, LineOnlyWithMusic` when it does not. Where no frame is still — a hum loud enough to keep
//      every frame above the threshold, or a line that never stops — nothing contradicts the line and it stands.
//      The test is the line's absence where everything was quiet, so a hum faint enough to sit under the threshold
//      is in the still pool and is heard there.
//   2. THE POSITION, MEASURED INSIDE THE BIN. A peak is accepted only if its INTERPOLATED position is within
//      `toleranceHz` (0.5 Hz) of 50 or 60. 0.5 Hz is what mains asks for and what the notes cannot have: a stiff
//      grid holds +-0.05 Hz and excurses to +-0.2 Hz, while the nearest note is 1.0 Hz away. It is also what
//      makes the resolution below non-negotiable — a bin centre would read "50.000" for anything in its bin.
//   3. IT STANDS STILL. The same line must be accepted in at least TWO quiet stretches, and the spread of every
//      position estimate — per stretch AND per frame — must stay inside `toleranceHz`. A note moves with the
//      music; one that merely passes through 50 Hz in one stretch gives one observation, and one observation is
//      not an answer (see SingleQuietStretch / the stationarity gate).
//   4. THE COMB IS REPORTED, NOT REQUIRED. Exact multiples corroborate, but a bass guitar's partials are also
//      near-exact multiples, so the comb is weak as a discriminator, and a well-filtered pickup can be
//      fundamental-only. Gating on a harmonic count would therefore buy little and cost a FALSE CLEAN, which is
//      the one outcome this instrument may not produce. `harmonicsObserved` is published so a consumer that
//      wants corroboration can ask for it. (A minimum harmonic count was argued for, and rejected for
//      that reason.)
//
// WHY EVERY PEAK IN THE WINDOW IS ENUMERATED, NOT JUST THE STRONGEST. This was the design's one real defect and
// two reviewers found it independently. Reading only the argmax of the search window means a LOUDER note 1 Hz
// away steals the window, fails the tolerance, and the real hum beneath it is never examined — a false clean,
// with the resolution paid for and unused. So `locate()` enumerates every strict interior local maximum in the
// window, accepts those inside the tolerance, and keeps the strongest of them; the strongest local maximum
// overall is published separately as `windowPeak`, accepted or not, so contradictory evidence is never censored.
// This costs nothing in false positives: for ONE Hann-windowed tone the sampled skirt is MONOTONE away from the
// main lobe — sampling W(m+f) on the bin grid leaves the |sin(pi*f)| factor constant, so the magnitude falls as
// 1/|m+f|^3 with no interior maximum at all. (The "sidelobe maxima at 2.36 bins" of the CONTINUOUS kernel, which
// one reviewer warned would fake a 50 Hz peak from a 49 Hz note, do not survive sampling: the bin at +2.36 is
// below the bin at +1.36. Verified analytically and by the suite's monotone-skirt witness.) Two tones CAN
// interfere into an extra maximum; the prominence gate and the stationarity gate are what answer that.
//
// RESOLUTION IS A DURATION. To SEPARATE 49.0 from 50.0 Hz — not merely to notice something there — two Hann main
// lobes must sit >= 2 bins apart: at exactly 2 bins the sum of the two kernels is flat across the pair
// (W(0) + W(2) = 0.5 + 0 = 0.5 = 2*W(1) = 2*0.25), and closer than that the dip is gone. 1.0 Hz / 2 bins gives
// bin <= 0.5 Hz, i.e. N >= 96000, i.e. N = 2^17 at 48 kHz (bin 0.366 Hz, window 2.73 s, and 2.73 bins of
// separation for a 6 dB dip). At 2^16 the pair is 1.37 bins apart and merges. Hence `fftOrder = 0` = AUTO: the
// smallest order whose bin is <= 0.5 Hz at this rate. An explicitly coarser order is honoured and answers
// `valid = false, InsufficientResolution` — never a guessed 50. Zero-padding would sharpen the POSITION
// estimate and would not separate the pair; it is not used, and the two must not be confused.
//
// THE QUIET GATE IS THE PROGRAMME'S LOUDNESS, NOT THE HUM'S. A frame's Hann-weighted mean square comes out of
// its own bins by Parseval — for this producer's calibration, P[0] + P[N/2] + 2*sum_{k=1}^{N/2-1} P[k] is
// exactly sum(x^2 w^2) / sum(w^2) (SpectrumFramesTests.cpp:169 pins it) — with two subtractions:
//   * bins 0 and 1 are dropped. Under a PERIODIC Hann a constant d has energy at exactly k = 0, 1, N-1
//     (w = 0.5 - 0.25 e^{+j} - 0.25 e^{-j}), with P0 = 2d^2/3 and 2*P1 = d^2/3 summing to d^2, so in exact
//     arithmetic this removes a DC offset completely — a converter's DC must not read as loudness. A double
//     window through a double FFT leaves a rounding residue, so the removal is exact in theory, not bitwise.
//     Genuine sub-bin programme content goes with it, and a DRIFTING offset or a ramp does not.
//   * the candidate bands are dropped: +-`searchHz` around every h*50 and h*60 for h = 1..`maxHarmonic`, merged.
//     Without this the defect censors its own detection — a -45 dBFS hum makes every frame "not quiet" and the
//     answer becomes NoQuietStretch on the very files that have the problem (found in review). 16 windows
//     of 6 Hz out of the whole band change a programme measure by nothing; they change this one by everything.
// A frame carrying ANY hole is never quiet: a holed frame's power is deliberately zeroed by the producer
// (SpectrumFrames.h:231) and reading that as silence would manufacture quiet stretches out of dropouts.
// LIMIT, NAMED: the Hann window weights a frame's own edges to zero, so a transient at a frame edge is invisible
// to THAT frame. At the default hop = N/2 every sample sits at the peak weight of some frame, so the transient
// makes a neighbouring frame loud and breaks the run — except inside the first hop of the stream and past the
// last full frame, where fewer frames cover a sample.
//
// A QUIET STRETCH is a maximal run of consecutive SELECTED FRAME INDICES, published as
// [first frame start, last frame end) in samples. Runs separated by any unselected frame are separate stretches
// and are never glued. The interval is a FRAME-SUPPORT ENVELOPE, not a proof that every sample in it was quiet,
// and at hop < N/2 two distinct runs can report overlapping intervals — read `frames` beside the coordinates.
//
// STATIONARITY NEEDS TWO STRETCHES, AND ONE IS ITS OWN ANSWER. "Stands still between stretches" cannot be tested
// inside one, so exactly one usable stretch is `valid = false, SingleQuietStretch` — a named incompleteness, not
// a quietly lowered requirement, and not "no hum". The provisional candidate is still published (it is evidence,
// and the danger here runs one way only), together with `maxIntraStretchSpreadHz` from the individual FRAME
// estimates inside that stretch, so a consumer can see how still the line was without the instrument certifying
// it. Considered and rejected: cutting one long run into artificial "stretches" — that would answer the
// requirement by redefining it.
//
// A RATIO IS NOT EVIDENCE ON ITS OWN, so a line must also be LOUD ENOUGH TO BE A LINE. `minLevelDbfs`
// (-100 dBFS on the tone's mean square) is the second half of the acceptance test, and it is what keeps the
// instrument out of its own arithmetic: a programme that is one pure tone, or one constant sample value,
// has a spectrum of 1e-23 to 1e-35 away from that tone, and a local maximum of THAT residue stands 18 to
// 37 dB above the residue beside it. Measured: a pure 440 Hz tone reported 60 Hz mains at -230 dBFS, a
// pure 700 Hz tone reported 50 Hz at -228 dBFS, and a constant +1.0 reported 50 Hz at -343 dBFS — all with
// two eligible stretches, because a pure tone's frames are identical and so is their residue. -100 dBFS is
// under the noise floor of a 16-bit delivery and 130 decades above that residue.
//
// FOUR LIMITS THE ADVERSARIAL ROUND MEASURED AND THAT NO THRESHOLD CAN REMOVE. They are named here rather
// than papered over, and in every one the report publishes the evidence a consumer needs:
//   * A NOTE SHARP OF G1 ENTERS THE BAND. G1 is 1.0 Hz from 50 at A = 440, but 20 cents sharp it is 49.57,
//     0.43 Hz away — inside the tolerance. A band tuned that sharp, holding a dead-steady drone through two
//     quiet passages, is reported. What saves the realistic version is the stationarity gate: a free vibrato
//     of +-1 Hz at 0.5 Hz was refused (one stretch observation, frame spread 0.07 Hz).
//   * A STRONG NEIGHBOUR BIASES THE POSITION by up to ~0.07 bins, so a line within ~0.03 Hz of the
//     tolerance edge can fall on either side of it: 49.000 + 50.510 Hz reads as 50.484 and is accepted.
//     Every threshold has an edge; this one's width is 8 % of a bin.
//   * A REAL 50 OR 60 Hz LINE OF MUSICAL ORIGIN IS STILL A 50 OR 60 Hz LINE. A 20 Hz tone's third harmonic
//     is exactly 60 Hz; a 100 Hz tone tremoloed at 50 Hz literally contains 50 Hz. Both are reported, and
//     both are correct under what `mains` claims. `bandPowerSum()` is where a consumer sees the 20 Hz
//     fundamental that explains it.
//   * A SPEED-SHIFTED TRANSFER MOVES THE LINE OUT OF THE BAND. A -1.2 % tape transfer puts 50 Hz at 49.4,
//     0.6 Hz out, and no tolerance can reach it without reaching G1. The line is published anyway, as the
//     candidate's `windowPeak` (position and prominence, accepted or not) and counted in
//     `stretchOffTolerance` — which is exactly what those two fields are for.
// And one that is the seam's, not this instrument's: hum living only in the UNCOVERED TAIL (less than one
// window at the end of the programme) is not analysed at all. `tailUncoveredSamples` names how much.
//
// ONE PERIODOGRAM IS NOT A LINE, AND THAT IS WHY A STRETCH MUST HOLD TWO FRAMES. A single frame's
// periodogram has an exponential tail: the chance that some bin of a search window stands 10 dB over the
// paired median of its neighbours is small but not small enough, and if the two quiet stretches carry the
// SAME noise — a looped passage, a repeated room tone, a silent section duplicated by an editor — the
// excursion repeats exactly and passes the stationarity test with it. MEASURED, 1200 noise-only files per
// cell at 4 kHz (a rate below the core's 8000 Hz floor now), with `minFramesPerObservation` = 1, i.e. the rule off,
// reported as mains:
//                                        10 dB   12 dB   14 dB   16 dB
//   one frame per stretch, independent        0       0       0       0
//   one frame per stretch, IDENTICAL noise   75       5       0       0
//   one frame per stretch, 16-bit dither     68       9       0       0
//   three frames per stretch, either way      0       0       0       0
// Two frames per stretch takes every one of those cells to 0 at every gate, and costs nothing: the weakest
// hum found is unchanged (2.2e-5 amplitude at 10 dB) for stretches that have two frames. Raising the gate
// instead would work — 14 dB clears the table too — but it would cost 4 dB of sensitivity on every file and
// leave the cause in place. So the gate stays at 10 dB and a stretch must show the line TWICE.
// The price is named rather than paid silently: fewer than two eligible stretches is
// `valid = false, StretchesTooShort`, never "no hum". At 48 kHz two frames is N + hop = 4.1 s of quiet.
// A LOOPED passage whose period puts a line inside the tolerance is NOT a false positive and is not treated
// as one: a buffer repeated every 997 samples at 4 kHz (below the core's floor now; the arithmetic is the point)
// really does carry a stationary line at 60.18 Hz with
// an exact harmonic comb, and no spectral instrument can call that anything else. The header's first
// paragraph is the answer to it: `mains` is a mains-COMPATIBLE line, not a causal claim.
//
// AVERAGING FRAMES DOES NOT MAKE A LINE EASIER TO SEE, which is worth knowing before tuning anything here:
// it raises the line and its background together, so the peak-to-floor ratio barely moves with frame count.
// What averaging buys is the stability of the estimate and the accuracy of its position. SENSITIVITY comes
// from the WINDOW: a longer one narrows the bin, which lowers the background in that bin while the line
// keeps its power. Measured consequence — a stretch's observation and its frames' observations appear and
// disappear at the same amplitude, at 3 frames per stretch and at 16 alike.
//
// THE LOCAL BACKGROUND, AND WHY IT IS PAIRED. A quiet passage is usually falling LF rumble, and a plain median
// over +-`floorSpanHz` excluding +-`floorExcludeHz` then lands on the largest bin of the QUIETER side — about
// -0.3 dB on a 1/f^2 slope, and ~3.7 dB on a steep one, straight into the prominence. So the floor is the lower
// median of PAIRED geometric means sqrt(P[kp-d])*sqrt(P[kp+d]) over symmetric offsets d: for a locally
// log-linear background every pair estimates the level AT the peak, and the slope cancels instead of biasing.
// Two square roots per pair, not one over the product, so a tiny power cannot underflow to zero. `prominenceDb`
// is 10*log10(tonePower/floorPower), taken once at the end; the GATE is `tone >= floor * 10^(min/10)` with the
// factor built in prepare(), so no libm call decides an acceptance (ClipDetector.h:53's rule).
//
// `tonePower` IS THE TONE'S MEAN SQUARE, not the peak bin. This calibration puts A^2/6 in the peak bin of a
// bin-centred sine of amplitude A; the three-bin folded sum 2*(P[kp-1] + P[kp] + P[kp+1]) is A^2/2 exactly,
// which is the number a consumer means by "the level of the hum", so that is what is published.
// BUT THE PROMINENCE IS MEASURED IN ONE BIN'S BANDWIDTH — `peakBinPower / floorPower`, not tonePower over it.
// The two must share a bandwidth or the ratio carries a constant that has nothing to do with a tone: six bins
// against one is 7.8 dB of head start, and the suite caught exactly that — pure noise cleared a 10 dB gate at
// 119.9 Hz in both quiet stretches of a 49.0 Hz BASS fixture and was reported as 60 Hz mains, base h = 2.
//
// THE COMB, IN TWO PASSES. Pass A fixes the BASE from h = 1 (tolerance 0.5 Hz) or else h = 2 (tolerance 1.0 Hz —
// h*toleranceHz, because a real grid's h-th harmonic is h times as far off nominal): the first that yields an
// accepted, prominent line gives f0est = position / h. Pass B then searches every h in 1..`maxHarmonic` around
// h*f0est within `harmonicToleranceBins` bins, which is where the accuracy is: f0est carries ~0.02 bin of
// estimator error, so h*that is under 0.2 bin at h = 8, inside a 2-bin window. 100/120 Hz with NO fundamental —
// full-wave rectification — therefore reports base 2, `fundamentalObserved = false`, and a fundamental marked
// DERIVED; the unobserved line is never asserted as seen.
// LIMIT, NAMED: the base is looked for at h = 1 and h = 2 only, which is the scope this class covers (the fundamental,
// and full-wave rectification's 100/120 Hz). A three-pulse rectifier's first ripple is 150/180 Hz and a
// three-phase six-pulse bridge's is 300/360 Hz, and 300 Hz is both 6*50 and 5*60 — which mains family produced
// it cannot be decided from audio without inventing the answer. So no `mains` is claimed there, but it is NOT
// reported as an absence either: when no base is found the harmonics are still scanned on the NOMINAL grid
// (tolerance h*toleranceHz), and >= 2 of them agreeing on one fundamental is `valid = false, CombWithoutBase`
// with `combFundamentalHz` and `lowestHarmonicObserved` naming what was seen. ONE prominent line at a multiple
// of 50 or 60 is not a comb and does not trigger it.
// LIMIT, NAMED: the comb is measured on the pooled average of every selected frame, so its components need not
// have CO-OCCURRED — two stretches of a bare 50 Hz line and one of a bare 150 Hz line pool into a comb. Per
// stretch, only the four fixed hypotheses (50 and 60 Hz at h = 1 and h = 2) are re-measured, and their per-
// stretch acceptance IS published, so co-occurrence is visible for the base and pooled for the rest.
//
// LAW 8a — bit-identical under ARBITRARY re-slicing into process() calls, and identical for any `maxBlock` at
// prepare(). What that costs in discipline: one integer clock (sample outside, channel inside, as
// ClipDetector.h:200); every completed frame consumed the instant tick() returns true, because the producer's
// power() is only readable until the next frame closes (SpectrumFrames.h:164) and reading once per process()
// would keep only the last one and make the answer a function of the block size; nothing closed, flushed or
// reset at a process() boundary; accumulators in double with one fixed recurrence each, bins ascending, frames
// in absolute order; ratios from accumulated numerator and denominator, never a mean of dB; one division by the
// integer frame count at the end. There is no IIR state and no per-sample recurrence in this instrument, so
// core::StateGrid has nothing to schedule here — the mutant that stands in for "maintenance moved to the call
// boundary" is the active stretch being closed at the end of process(), and the suite is red on it.
//
// CAPACITY IS DATA, NOT CONTROL (law 11d). `maxStretches` bounds the reportable stretch LIST and nothing else:
// the 257th stretch gets its absolute index, contributes every frame to every accumulator, is measured through
// the same reusable active buffer and updates every candidate summary — only its coordinate record is not
// stored, and `stretchesComplete` says so. A capacity of 256 and one of 512 must classify identically. The same
// holds for the frame trace.
//
// FORM. setParams / prepare / process / finish / reset, with Storage + storageFor() published before anything is
// allocated. process() is read-only and allocates nothing; the report is final after finish(), which is
// idempotent and closes the open stretch at its last selected frame's end — it invents no tail frame, because
// the producer emits none (SpectrumFrames.h:180). Every accessor is total: an index outside the report answers a
// zeroed value rather than reading past a vector.
//
// RT: OFFLINE (message thread). A 2^17 frame per 1.365 s of programme is a second or two for a five-minute file.
