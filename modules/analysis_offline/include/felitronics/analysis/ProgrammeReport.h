//==============================================================================
// felitronics::analysis::ProgrammeReport — ONE offline pass over a delivered programme, and the continuous
// evidence it leaves: where the silence is, how much the channels differ, what sits under 30 Hz, how far
// the loudness travels. It reports COORDINATES AND NUMBERS, never a verdict: nothing here says "too loud",
// "this is a problem" or "you have rumble". Where the programme cannot support a number, the field says so
// — `valid = false` with a `reason` — instead of publishing a zero that reads as "fine".
//
// WHAT IT MEASURES
//   · DC OFFSET per channel — the mean sample value over the PROGRAMME SPAN (below).
//   · SILENCE at the head and at the tail, twice over: as a count of samples at or below a named THRESHOLD
//     (a parameter, default -96 dBFS), and as a count of EXACT digital silence, which needs no threshold at
//     all. Both are counts; neither is a verdict about whether that silence belongs there.
//   · THE TAIL — the energy of the last `tailWindowMs` of PROGRAMME relative to the programme's own mean
//     square, plus the last sample of the file and the last sample before the trailing digital silence. A
//     fade that was cut off leaves a tail ratio near 1 and a large last signal sample; a fade that
//     completed leaves both small. The instrument states the numbers; what they mean is the reader's.
//   · INFRA-LOW — the fraction of energy below `infraLowHz` (default 30 Hz), where "below" means WHAT THE
//     LR4 PASSES (see THE INFRA-LOW FRACTION IS A FILTER, NOT A BAND below). Not an ideal brick wall, and
//     the difference is large enough to mislead a reader who is not told.
//   · STEREO — the L/R level difference, whether the two channels are bit-identical, the integral
//     correlation over the whole programme (`analysis::StereoSums`, the same arithmetic
//     `fcore_measure correlation` runs), and the side/mid energy ratio.
//   · DYNAMICS — integrated loudness, reference true peak, PLR, LRA (EBU Tech 3342) and the percentiles of
//     the short-term loudness distribution, plus the crest factor.
//
// THE PROGRAMME SPAN, AND WHY EVERY MEAN IS TAKEN OVER IT. The span runs from the first to the last FRAME
// whose loudest finite present channel EXCEEDS `silenceThresholdDb`. Every mean square, every RMS, every
// crest factor and the DC offset are taken over the span, and the tail window ENDS at the last such frame
// rather than at the last sample of the file. The consequence is the property this report is built on:
// PADDING A MASTER DOES NOT MOVE ITS MEASUREMENTS. Pad the same music with five seconds of silence at both
// ends and the DC, the sample peak, the RMS, the crest factor, the infra-low fraction, the programme mean
// square, the tail ratio, the stereo relations and the reference TRUE PEAK all come back bit-identical.
// Measured over the whole file instead, every one of them moves for a reason that has nothing to do with
// the music: the mean square of a 60 s programme padded to 70 s falls by 0.67 dB, and the tail window lands
// entirely inside the padding and reads 0 — a truncated fade reporting as a perfect one.
//
// WHY THE THRESHOLD AND NOT EXACT ZERO, which reads cleaner and was the first design. An exact-zero span is
// a CLIFF exactly where masters live: a 24-bit dithered file — the dominant delivery format — has no exact
// zero anywhere, so its five "silent" seconds are ±2e-7 of dither, an exact-zero span swallows them, the
// RMS is diluted by 5.4 dB, and a programme cut mid-fade reads a tail ratio of 9.1e-12 instead of 1.0. So
// the cliff would sit under most real files and the invariance would apply to almost none of them. Against
// the threshold, |0| > thr is false for every threshold this class accepts, so digital padding stays
// bit-exactly invariant AND sub-threshold padding becomes invariant too.
//
// WHAT PADDING DOES MOVE, named rather than left to be discovered: `lastSample` (which is by definition the
// last sample of the FILE — `lastSignalSample` is its padding-invariant companion), and the LOUDNESS FAMILY
// (integrated, PLR, LRA, the short-term percentiles). BS.1770 anchors its 400 ms gating blocks and 3 s
// windows at the start of the stream, so a pad changes which windows straddle the music's edges even when
// it is a whole number of sub-hops. Anchoring the sub-meters at the first active frame would make these
// invariant too and is deliberately NOT done: it would put this report's loudness at odds with
// `fcore_measure lufs`, ffmpeg's ebur128 and every other EBU tool on the same file, which is a worse trade
// than a padding-sensitive LUFS. The suite pins the whole split as an allow-list.
//
// THE INFRA-LOW FRACTION IS A FILTER, NOT A BAND. The split is `eq::Crossover2` — a 4th-order
// Linkwitz-Riley, i.e. two cascaded Butterworth (Q = 1/√2) sections, so
//
//     |LP_LR4(f)|² = 1 / (1 + (f/fc)⁴)²        — NOT 1/(1 + (f/fc)⁸), which is 4th-order BUTTERWORTH
//
// and the two are not close. LR4 is -6 dB at its crossover (that is what makes low + high reconstruct
// flat), so with fc = 30 Hz a pure 30 Hz tone reads 25 % "below 30 Hz", not 50 %. A pure 40 Hz tone reads
// 5.78 %, a 60 Hz tone 0.346 %, and flat noise to Nyquist reads 0.104 % at 48 kHz (the filter's equivalent
// rectangular bandwidth is 30·3π/(8√2) = 24.99 Hz). So a few per cent "below 30 Hz" on a bass-heavy master
// is very often the FUNDAMENTAL at 40 Hz seen through the skirt of the filter, and not infrasound at all.
// The number is honest and useful; reading it as an ideal band is not. Reported per channel and over the
// programme. Two further properties of the definition, so neither is discovered as a surprise: the ratio
// is Σ lp4(x)² / Σ x² over the span, which equals the |H|²-weighted integral only in the limit — the
// filter's warm-up from `reset()` is inside the window and its ring-down past the last signal frame is
// outside it — and a 100 ms fixture at 40 Hz is four cycles, dominated by that warm-up rather than by the
// steady-state 5.78 %.
//
// "CANNOT SAY" IS A RESULT. A mono file does not get a correlation of +1.0 — it gets
// `valid = false, reason = MonoProgramme`. A programme shorter than the tail window does not get a ratio of
// exactly 1.0. A programme with fewer than two gated short-term observations does not get an LRA of 0.0,
// which is also the honest answer for a constant tone. An invalid field's `value` is a documented
// canonical +0.0 — never a NaN, which this repository does not use as an absence marker (a computed NaN's
// sign bit is not even portable: 0x7ff8… on arm64, 0xfff8… on x86-64).
//
// TWO PRIMITIVES ARE WRAPPED BECAUSE THEIR OWN DEFAULTS ARE VERDICTS, and that is worth naming:
//   · `StereoSums::correlation()` answers +1.0 when √(ΣLL·ΣRR) ≤ 1e-12 — "silence is neutral"
//     (StereoColumns.h:56). For a page drawing a meter that is right; for a report it says "perfectly
//     mono-compatible" about a programme that carries no stereo information at all. Here that case is
//     `valid = false, reason = SilentProgramme`, and the NUMBER, when valid, is that primitive's own, bit
//     for bit, so this report and `fcore_measure correlation` cannot disagree.
//   · `LoudnessMeter::integratedLufs()` answers -120.0 when no block passed the gates. That is a SENTINEL,
//     not a measurement, and it is invalid here.
//   · And LRA is NOT read from `LoudnessMeter::loudnessRangeLu()`, for the same class of reason: that
//     function answers 0.0 both for a constant tone (whose range really is 0 LU) and for a programme where
//     the gates left fewer than two short-term observations, and from outside the meter the two cannot be
//     told apart. EBU Tech 3342 is computed here from this class's own short-term series, where the gated
//     count is known exactly.
//
//     They agree to about 0.3 LU wherever both are defined — not bitwise, and the reason is worth knowing:
//     the meter sums its short-term window newest-first (LoudnessMeter::meanLastSubHops) and this class
//     oldest-first, so the two orders leave different residues. The suite pins the agreement at that
//     tolerance, on steady material AND on a square envelope whose states last exactly the 3 s window.
//
//     THAT SECOND FIXTURE IS THERE BECAUSE THE PAIR ONCE CAME APART. Until v0.43 this class sampled its
//     series once a second (libebur128's cadence) while the meter had moved to the 10 Hz EBU Tech 3342 §3.1
//     requires — and two numbers carrying that standard's name read 20.00 LU here against 9.50 there, at
//     44.1 and 48 kHz, over 12, 30 and 120 s programmes. The agreement check of the day kept passing the
//     whole time, because its only fixture was long steady steps, where every window that is not straddling
//     a step reads the same value and the sampling cadence cannot matter. Both cadences are 10 Hz now
//     (`kObservationHops = 10`), and the guard is held on a fixture that can tell them apart.
//
// FORM. setParams / prepare / process / finish / reset, like `analysis::ClipDetector`. `process()` is
// READ-ONLY and allocates nothing; `finish()` drains the true-peak filter, closes the report and freezes
// it, is idempotent, and `process()` refuses until `reset()`. Every parameter is read at `prepare()` and
// not before — so the report can never depend on WHEN the caller called `setParams()`.
//
// LAW 8a — BIT-IDENTICAL UNDER ANY RE-SPLIT. With the same input bits, the same parameters, the same
// binary and the same per-sample timeline of channel presence, every field of the report — and every
// intermediate the trace hook below exposes — is bit-identical however the caller cuts the stream into
// `process()` calls. This is stronger than law 11(a), which only promises agreement with the caller
// chunking at the SAME boundaries (DSP-ARCHITECTURE.md:273), and it is what the design is arranged around:
//   · ONE integer clock. `totalSamples_` counts samples since `reset()`; the outer loop is over SAMPLES and
//     the inner over CHANNELS, because a cross-channel accumulator filled channel-outer adds in a different
//     order for a 2-sample call than for two 1-sample calls, and a different order is different bits.
//   · `maxBlock` sizes the scratch and NOTHING else — no window, no hop, no branch. A call longer than
//     `maxBlock` is consumed IN FULL; a refused call consumes nothing; `n == 0` changes nothing at all.
//   · Sub-hop boundaries are found by `totalSamples_ == nextSubHopEnd_`, never by a modulo.
//   · The denormal flush of the infra-low crossover rides `core::StateGrid` (64 samples of AUDIO time), not
//     the end of `process()` — `eq::Crossover2::processSample` does not clock itself (Crossover2.h:52), so
//     the owner must. The K-weighting flush rides the 10 ms sub-hop, the cadence `LoudnessMeter` documents
//     for the same filter (its binding constant is the 90 ms shelf, not the 2.85 s RLB).
//   · The sliding 3 s window is RECOMPUTED from its ring at each observation, never carried as
//     `sum += new - old`, which is deterministic but drifts over a million hops.
//   · Every accumulator is one fixed recurrence in `double`; the compensated (Neumaier) sums hold two
//     constant scalars and nothing that depends on where a call ended.
//   · `LoudnessMeter` and `ReferenceTruePeakMeter` both carry a falling-edge action keyed on the CALL's
//     width (their `ranNc_`). They are therefore driven here at a CONSTANT width through a scratch buffer,
//     with canonical zeros for a channel the caller stopped delivering, so that edge never fires. Feeding
//     silence is also the honest state for a whole-programme report: law 11c's "the channel heard
//     silence", and exactly what `ReferenceTruePeakMeter::drain()` feeds a stopped channel anyway.
// CROSS-ROW BIT-IDENTITY: MEASURED, AND NOT YET GUARANTEED BY CONSTRUCTION. Say the weaker thing,
// because it is the true one.
//   WHAT IS MEASURED: `fcore_measure report` on the fixtures this release ships is byte-identical across
//   Apple clang/arm64, gcc 14/glibc x86-64 and wasm32/musl, at 48 and 44.1 kHz — every count and all 31
//   scalars. That holds for a build that does NOT contract, which both shipped roads are
//   (-ffp-contract=off in tools/CMakeLists.txt and tools/wasm/build.sh); rebuilt with the library's own
//   default of contraction on, 4 lines move, because the arithmetic AROUND the deterministic calls is
//   contractible even though the calls are pinned.
//   WIDENED BY THE LIBM AUDIT, because two rates on one fixture is a narrow thing to rest a promise on. 114 further
//   comparisons, Apple clang/arm64 against wasm32/musl, every one byte-identical: `report`, `forensics`,
//   `hum`, `lowend` and `bursts` at 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4 and 192 kHz in mono, stereo and 6 channels
//   (90), and those five plus `clips` on four edge-shaped inputs — a ONE-FRAME file, a three-frame file,
//   a second of exact digital silence, and a programme carrying a NaN and an +inf (24). The refusal set
//   was compared too, not just the successful runs: native and wasm exit with the same status on every
//   one of them. `report` is also byte-identical Apple-vs-glibc on the shipped fixture.
//   WHAT THE LIBM AUDIT CLOSED: the three derivations this paragraph used to name as open. All three now reach
//   `core::det` instead of the system libm, and none of them moved a bit of anything shipped:
//     · `core::offline::fftInplace`'s stage twiddles are det::cos/det::sin. The 2*log2(N) seed angles are
//       ones where Apple, glibc and musl already agreed with each other and with det, so the transform's
//       output is unchanged on every row — the agreement was observed before and is built in now.
//     · the dBTP field goes through `core::gainToDbDet`. `core::gainToDb` itself did NOT move and must
//       not: it runs once per sample on four paths, worst of them inside TruePeakLimiter's oversampled
//       loop. The split is by CONSUMER, and tools/lint/check-det-math.mjs is what keeps it that way.
//     · PolyphaseOversampler designs its taps with det::sin. The taps are narrowed to float, which
//       discards 29 of the bits the libms can disagree about: measured, the 4x32 prototype is
//       byte-identical across Apple clang/arm64, gcc 14/glibc, emcc/musl AND MSVC/UCRT, before and after,
//       and OversamplingTests pins all 128 of them against the pre-change table.
//   WHAT IS STILL NOT GUARANTEED, and it is no longer a libm question:
//     · CONTRACTION. The 4 lines above still move under -ffp-contract=on (re-measured after the libm audit:
//       integratedLufs, plrDb, shortTermP50, shortTermP95). Both shipped roads state contraction off;
//       nothing here claims identity for a build that does not.
//     · A CONSUMER'S UNSAFE MATH. -ffast-math or -funsafe-math-optimizations in a translation unit that
//       includes DetMath.h rewrites its Dekker splits and polynomial accumulations, and det stops being
//       one function. DetMath.h refuses to compile under the flags that can be detected; clang defines no
//       macro for a bare -funsafe-math-optimizations, so DetMathTests carries a runtime pin for that hole.
//     · `std::abs` on a complex in `core::offline::magSpectrum` is `hypot`, which no det:: function
//       replaces. It is out of this report's path (the analyzers take their magnitudes from
//       SpectrumFrames, which squares and sums), and it is recorded in the lint's ZONE_EXCEPTIONS.
//   WHAT CHANGED IN v0.33.0: the transcendentals that DECIDE this report — every dB value, every
//   threshold, the window every power bin is multiplied by — moved to `core::det`. That was the share no
//   build flag could reach, and before v0.33.0 this paragraph said there was no cross-platform identity
//   at all, which was true then.
//
// NON-FINITE INPUT. A non-finite sample is a HOLE: a canonical 0.0f goes into every filter, the sample
// enters no statistic, and it is counted per channel. What that invalidates is drawn along one line —
// A HOLE IS EXCLUDED WHERE EXCLUSION IS EXACT, AND FATAL WHERE STATE CARRIES IT FORWARD:
//   · DC, RMS, crest factor, the stereo sums and the tail window are sums over the finite samples; dropping
//     one term is exact, so they stay valid and the counts are published beside them.
//   · The infra-low fraction, the loudness family and the short-term percentiles run through recursive
//     filters that carry the substitution forward for their whole ring-down. Any non-finite input makes
//     them `valid = false, reason = NonFiniteInput`.
// AND FINITE INPUT IS NOT ENOUGH. `eq::Svf` updates its integrators as `ic1 = (float)(2·v1 - ic1)`, and
// that intermediate can leave the float range even where the state itself is not growing — a stream of
// finite FLT_MAX drives the 30 Hz crossover non-finite at sample 849 exactly, even with the grid flush
// running (a 1.7e38 DC input does NOT overflow, so "the state doubles every sample" would be the wrong
// mechanism to quote)
// — measured. The K-weighting biquads and `StereoSums`'s products overflow the same way. So every
// intermediate is tested for finiteness where it is produced, the event is counted, and the field it feeds
// becomes `valid = false, reason = NonFiniteIntermediate`. Nothing non-finite reaches an accumulator or
// the trace. This is also why `LoudnessMeter::nonFiniteSubHops()` is published even though this class
// sanitises what it feeds the meter: that counter still fires on a FINITE input that overflows the
// K-weighting, which an input-side count cannot see.
//
// CAPACITY IS DATA, NOT CONTROL. `LoudnessMeter` keeps every gating block to the end (its relative gate is
// a two-pass) and drops what will not fit, counting it in `droppedBlocks()`; the short-term series kept
// here for LRA has its own capacity. Both are sized from `maxDurationSec` and both are PUBLISHED by
// `storageFor()` before a byte is allocated (law 11d). Overflow never stops the measurement and never
// refuses a call — it invalidates exactly the fields it damages, with `reason = LoudnessCapacityExceeded`,
// and every counter keeps counting.

//==============================================================================

// would make the report a function of the caller's timeline, which is precisely what law 8a forbids.
