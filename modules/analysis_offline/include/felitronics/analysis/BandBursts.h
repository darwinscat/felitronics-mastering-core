// felitronics::analysis::BandBursts — finds BURSTS of energy in one frequency band (5–9 kHz by default):
// the places where the band rises above ITS OWN SURROUNDINGS, with their coordinates, how far above they
// rose, and how REGULARLY they recur.
//
// WHY A BURST AND NOT A BALANCE. "Too much sibilance", "harshness" and "too much air" are usually asked of
// a target curve — a claim that this programme's 5–9 kHz should sit where some other programme's does.
// That claim needs a reference the core does not have and cannot honestly invent. An EXCESS OVER ITS OWN
// SURROUNDINGS needs none: it is a statement about this programme only, and it survives the two things
// that destroy a balance measurement — a different genre, and a different overall level. The instrument
// therefore measures a RATIO of the band against itself over time, never the band against full scale and
// never the band against a curve.
//
// A CONSEQUENCE, STATED FIRST BECAUSE IT IS THE POINT: the report does not change when the whole programme
// is turned up. Multiplying every sample by a power of two scales every hop energy and the baseline by the
// same exact factor, so every comparison, every coordinate and every dB in the report is bit-identical.
// If a change of level moved a number here, this would be a level meter wearing a burst detector's name.
//   THE ONE EXCEPTION, because an unconditional version of that sentence is false: `core::flushDenormal`
//   zeroes filter state below a FIXED 1e-15, which is not a homogeneous operation, so at amplitudes near
//   and below that floor the two renders diverge. Measured during the review round, on a fixture that is
//   NOT in the suite and is described here so the figure is not an unstated measurement: a 6 kHz
//   programme of 40 hops at amplitude 1e-15, three hops at 1e-14 and ten more at 1e-15, against a 20-hop
//   ring at 48 kHz, reports a peak excess of 20.64179744144726 dB, while the same programme doubled
//   sample by sample reports 20.526561047779559 dB. A second measurement found the underlying divergence on
//   27 of 256 grid alignments. Overflow to inf at the top and float subnormals at the bottom
//   break it for the same reason. Over the whole range a delivered programme actually occupies — roughly
//   1e-9 to 1 — the invariance is exact, and that is what the suite pins.
//
// NO FFT, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. A band is a FILTER; a spectrum is a detour that costs a transform per hop
// and adds a second source of cross-platform divergence for a number that is then summed back into one
// scalar anyway. The band is `high` of an `eq::Crossover2` at `bandLowHz` fed into `low` of a second at
// `bandHighHz` — two 4th-order Linkwitz-Riley skirts, minimum phase, zero latency by construction
// (`eq::Crossover2::latencySamples() == 0`).
//   BOTH OUTPUTS OF BOTH CROSSOVERS ARE COMPUTED AND TWO ARE DISCARDED. `Crossover2::processSample()` has
//   no one-sided form (`Crossover2.h:52`), so all EIGHT SVF sections run, hold recursive state and are
//   flushed; only four of them are read. That is the price of not writing a fifth private LR4 in this
//   repository. It is paid once per sample per channel offline, and the discarded sections are live state
//   rather than idle — which is why the flush below covers both crossovers whole.
//   GROUP DELAY IS NAMED AND NOT COMPENSATED, and the figure is the DIGITAL one. The analog LR4 formula
//   2·√2/ω_c (90 µs at 5 kHz) understates the prewarped filter, so the cascade's phase was differentiated
//   numerically instead: across 4.5–9.6 kHz the worst delay is 0.160 ms at 44.1 kHz, 0.160 at 48, 0.158
//   at 96 and 0.157 at 192 kHz — nearly rate-independent in TIME, and ≤ 1.6 % of a default 10 ms hop.
//   In SAMPLES it is not small — that same worst case is 7.67 samples at 48 kHz and 30.2 at 192 — so
//   this is a hop-scale argument and not a sub-sample one.
//   AND IT BLOWS UP WHERE THE HIGH CORNER MEETS 0.49·fs. The BLT prewarp stretches without bound as a
//   corner approaches Nyquist: at 18368 Hz — the first INTEGER rate at which the default band is accepted
//   (the bound is 9000/0.49 = 18367.35, and every rate above it is accepted) — the delay at 9 kHz is
//   2.54 ms and the worst in-band value is 3.04 ms, a THIRD of a hop. So the
//   "fraction of a hop" claim holds from about 22 kHz upward and is stated with that bound rather than
//   as a property of the filter. It is still not compensated: the delay is a smooth function of
//   frequency, so there is no single number to subtract, and an event's coordinates are deliberately
//   reported on the INPUT timeline.
//
// THE BAND IS A DOME, NOT A PLATEAU, AND ITS GAIN MOVES WITH THE SAMPLE RATE. This is why nothing here is
// called "band energy in dBFS". The LR4 pair does not multiply the band by one: computed over the cascade
// HP4(5k)²·LP4(9k)², its passband PEAK is −3.99 dB at 6791 Hz at 48 kHz, and 5 kHz and 9 kHz each sit
// 2.59 dB below that peak — the corners are the −6 dB points of their own skirts, which is what an LR4
// crossover is for and is not a flat band. Worse for absolute use, the peak gain is PREWARP-dependent and
// therefore rate-dependent: −1.11 dB at 22.05 kHz, −3.86 at 44.1, −3.99 at 48, −4.51 at 96, −4.66 at
// 384 kHz. A product comparing the absolute band power of a 44.1 kHz master against a 96 kHz one would be
// wrong by 0.65 dB. So: every ABSOLUTE power published here (`peakPower`, `peakBaseline`, `bandEnergy`,
// `tailPartialEnergy`, the trace's `energy`) is UNCALIBRATED FILTER-OUTPUT POWER, comparable within one
// prepared instrument and not across sample rates.
//   A RATIO IS IMMUNE TO A GAIN, AND ONLY PARTLY IMMUNE TO A CHANGE OF SPECTRUM — the weaker claim is the
//   true one. When the burst and its baseline have the same spectral shape the dome cancels exactly and
//   the excess is a pure power ratio. When they do NOT, each side is weighted by a different point of a
//   dome whose shape moves with the rate, and the excess moves with it: a 5 kHz baseline under a 7 kHz
//   burst measures 22.66 dB at 44.1 kHz and 22.20 dB at 96 kHz. Half a dB, from the rate alone. Every
//   gain-invariance claim in this file is exact; no cross-RATE claim is made for a spectral change.
//
// THE RULE.
//   · The programme is cut into HOPS of `hopMs` (10 ms). A hop's ENERGY is the sum over channels and over
//     the hop's samples of the squared band signal — one programme-wide number, because a burst in a mix
//     is one event and not one per channel. Per-channel band energy TOTALS are published separately, so a
//     consumer can still see which channel carries the band.
//   · A hop's BASELINE is the MEDIAN of the `baselineMs / hopMs` hops BEFORE it (200 hops = 2 s), and the
//     hop itself is not in it: the thing being measured is not part of its own surroundings. The hop is
//     DECIDED against the ring and only then WRITTEN into it. What the other order costs is NOT the
//     7.7 dB an earlier draft quoted — that is mean arithmetic, and on a ring of 200 equal energies
//     including a 1000× hop leaves the median exactly where it was, a 0 dB change. What it really does is
//     shift the window by one hop (the write evicts hop k−N early), which moves the median on any
//     material that is not constant. The mutant is caught by the oracle, not by a dB figure.
//   · A hop is ABOVE when `energy > baseline · 10^(enterDb/10)`, and an open burst STAYS open while
//     `energy > baseline · 10^(exitDb/10)`. An EVENT is a maximal run of above-hops. Its start, length,
//     integrated energy, peak hop, the peak's excess in dB, and the WIDEBAND power at that peak are
//     published.
//   · Onsets feed two integer histograms — the spacing of ADJACENT events, and the bounded-lag
//     AUTOCORRELATION of the onset train — which is how a regular hi-hat is told from single flashes.
//     The core publishes the counts. It does NOT publish "this is a hi-hat" or "this is a problem".
//
// WHY THE MEDIAN AND NOT THE MEAN — the decision this module turns on. A mean baseline is a burst detector
// that switches itself off exactly where bursts are densest, and the bound is embarrassingly low: a steady
// train of bursts with duty cycle d over a silent floor has mean = d·peak, so the excess is 1/d and the
// train is INVISIBLE once d ≥ 1/10^(enterDb/10) = 25.1 % at the default 6 dB. Sixteenth-note hats are past
// that. The mean fails four more ways, each found independently in design review:
//   · 5 loud hops against 5 silent ones — a 50 % duty pattern, i.e. most drum programmes — measures
//     3.01 dB and never fires at all;
//   · moving one onset 10 ms earlier flips it from found to missed, because one burst hop already in the
//     ring lifts the mean by 1.5 % while a ×4 burst clears 6 dB by only 0.5 %;
//   · 151 zeroed hops (a dropout) leave a mean of 0.245·B, and the programme RESUMING at its ordinary
//     level then reads as a 6.1 dB burst — a false event manufactured by the hole before it;
//   · the FIRST hat of a track is measured against a hat-free mean and reads ≈ 20 dB while every later
//     identical hat, measured against a mean the hats themselves lifted, reads ≈ 13 dB. The "worst
//     excess" coordinate then depends on programme ORDER, which for an offline instrument is pure loss.
// The median is immune to all five: a value that is not in the middle of the ring cannot move it. The
// duty-cycle bound rises from 25.1 % to 50 %, and — the part worth the most — it stops depending on the
// threshold at all. Above 50 % duty the bursts ARE the surroundings and the instrument reports no events.
//   AND THERE IS NO WARNING AT THAT BOUNDARY. `burstHops()/eligibleHops()` is a useful duty figure BELOW
//   the bound, but it cannot signal the bound itself: at 50 % duty the median already sits at the high
//   level, so nothing is above threshold, so the detected duty reads ZERO — the same output a clean
//   programme gives. An earlier draft of this comment claimed that ratio was the diagnostic; it is not,
//   and there is no other. That is why the limit is stated here, in the header, rather than left to be
//   detected: a consumer who needs to distinguish "no bursts" from "bursts everywhere" must compare the
//   band's energy against a second instrument, or widen `baselineMs` past the pattern.
//   THE MEDIAN ALSO REMOVES AN ARITHMETIC QUESTION INSTEAD OF ANSWERING IT. It is a SELECTION, not an
//   accumulation: the baseline is always one of the observed hop energies, bit for bit, so there is no
//   summation order to pin, no compensation to argue about and no drift over a million hops. The window
//   sum it replaces would have needed all three — `LoudnessMeter::meanLastSubHops` recomputes its window from the
//   ring every hop for exactly that reason, and note it walks newest→oldest, one more convention that
//   would have needed its own pinned test (and whose reversal no re-slicing test can see, because both
//   orders are slicing-invariant). None of it is needed here. `baselineHops/2` is the upper median for an
//   even count; there is no interpolation, because interpolating would put a number in the baseline that
//   no hop ever measured.
//
// A STEP CANNOT OUTLIVE THE BASELINE'S ADAPTATION, and that much is a counting theorem. Burst hops enter
// the ring like any others, and the median sits at sorted index `baselineHops/2`, so that index becomes a
// burst hop once ⌈baselineHops/2⌉ of them are in the ring — at which point the ratio falls to about 1 and
// the event ends. For a step to a CONSTANT level well above the exit ratio the length is exactly that:
// 100 hops (1.00 s) at the defaults, and measured 1, 2, 3 hops at `baselineHops` = 1, 3, 5, which is
// ⌈N/2⌉ and not `N/2`.
//   IT IS NOT A BOUND ON EVERY EVENT, and the earlier draft of this comment claimed it was. A signal that
//   keeps RISING holds an event open indefinitely, because the median chases it from behind and never
//   catches up: a 15 %-per-hop ramp over 40 hops against a 20-hop ring is ONE 40-hop event. So the
//   theorem is about a step, the cap is about a step, and a long event means either a step or a ramp —
//   which the event's own energy and peak coordinate distinguish.
//   AND THAT IS ALSO THE SIGNATURE OF A LEVEL STEP, which is the one artifact a local baseline cannot
//   avoid. A file that opens with a quiet lead-in (a fade-in, a dithered floor) and then plays produces
//   ONE event at the start, ⌈baselineHops/2⌉ hops long, with a huge excess; so does any hard section
//   change. A local-baseline instrument cannot tell a step from a burst at the moment of the step — but
//   the LENGTH tells them apart afterwards, and it is published: a sibilant is 5–15 hops, a step is
//   ⌈baselineHops/2⌉ hops and ends by adaptation. A consumer reads the length before the excess.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, AND SAYS SO.
//   · A burst pattern at or above 50 % duty, and a step's excess past ⌈baselineHops/2⌉ hops (both above).
//   · A band whose CONTENT is narrower than about 1/hopMs. Resolution here is set by the band-time
//     product: a 4 kHz band over a 10 ms hop has ≈ 2·B·H = 80 degrees of freedom, so a stationary
//     BROADBAND programme's hop energy varies by only 0.6375 dB (1σ) and the default 6 dB threshold is
//     9.41σ away. The χ²₈₀ upper tail at 10^0.6 of the mean is 3.4e-30 — a COMPUTED figure, quoted as a
//     scale and not as a measurement: the suite's stationary-bright test asserts zero events over some
//     hundreds of judged hops, which is all a test of that length can assert. Narrow the
//     content to ≈ 20 Hz and the hop energy becomes nearly exponential, a few percent of hops exceed
//     6 dB, and the detector fires. It is not wrong to: a 20 Hz-wide band at 6 kHz genuinely fluctuates
//     by more than 6 dB several times a second. That is a tremolo, and the instrument reports the tremolo.
//   · The first `baselineHops` hops have no baseline and are not judged. With the defaults the first
//     eligible hop is hop 200, which ENDS at 2.01 s — so a programme needs `(baselineHops + 1)` whole
//     hops before anything is looked at, which is why the reason below is `NoEligibleHop` and not
//     "shorter than the baseline".
//   · An open hi-hat whose decay never falls back to within `exitDb` OF the median merges its hits into
//     one event — the stay test is `energy > baseline · 10^(exitDb/10)`, so an event runs while the band
//     is still ABOVE the median by more than `exitDb`, and equality closes it —
//     the hysteresis that stops one sibilant SPLITTING is the same mechanism that MERGES a fast roll.
//     The event's length and `hops` are the evidence that it did.
//   · Order. The adjacent-spacing histogram is a distribution, so a pattern and a shuffle of the same
//     spacings read alike. The autocorrelation recovers SOME of what that loses but not all of it, and
//     in particular it is REVERSAL-BLIND: onsets at {0,10,30,60} and {0,30,50,60} have the same multiset
//     of pair distances {10,20,30,30,50,60} and therefore identical adjacent histograms AND identical
//     lag histograms. The full onset sequence is in the event list's `start` fields for as long as the
//     list holds, and that is the only place order survives.
//   · Tempo drift, in `modalIntervalMass()`: the window is ± ONE HOP, so its tolerance is ±1/P of the
//     period — ±8.3 % at a 12-hop period, ±0.2 % at 512. A hand-played hat whose jitter exceeds one hop
//     spreads past the window and reads as less periodic than it is. The full histogram and the
//     autocorrelation are published because that scalar alone would lie.
//
// NO EVIDENCE IS NOT A ZERO. Two situations produce no number rather than a reassuring one:
//   · No hop was ever eligible — `eventsValid()` is false with reason `NoEligibleHop`. An empty event
//     list then means "not looked at", not "clean".
//   · A hop whose baseline is EXACTLY zero — more than half its ring is digital silence — is not judged.
//     An excess over nothing is not a number. Without this gate the first non-zero sample after a silent
//     lead-in opens an event at ANY level, and its peak then FREEZES on the silence boundary, because a
//     zero denominator makes the strict cross-multiplication below reject every later hop however much
//     worse it is. (The published dB would NOT be +∞ — `closeEvent`'s own `peakDen_ > 0.0` guard writes
//     0.0 — which is if anything worse: a fabricated event reporting 0.0 dB of excess.) Counted in
//     `zeroBaselineHops()`.
// An invalid quantity reads 0.0. NaN is never used to mean "no value", and no published double is ever
// non-finite.
//
// NON-FINITE INPUT, AND THE PART THAT IS NOT ABOUT THE INPUT. A non-finite sample is counted, its first
// coordinate recorded, and a canonical 0.0f substituted BEFORE the filters, so nothing non-finite reaches
// an IIR, a square or an accumulator. That alone is NOT enough here: `eq::Svf` narrows its state to float
// (`Svf.h:91`) and a FINITE input can overflow it — successive +3e38f, −3e38f drive the 5 kHz HP4
// non-finite on the SECOND sample (its first 2nd-order section emits −inf and the second turns that into
// NaN), which `Svf.h:100` documents for 3e38 and `Svf.h:134` for a sign-alternating 1e37. So the FILTER
// OUTPUT is gated too, and a hop that hit either gate is DAMAGED: counted, flagged on any event that
// contains one, and flagged on any event whose BASELINE ring held one (`baselineTouchedNonFinite` — a
// burst can be manufactured entirely by damage that happened before it, so damage to the REFERENCE has to
// be visible on the event and not only in a global counter). The filter state is healed at the next
// `core::StateGrid` boundary; the hop and ring values an inf would have poisoned are not healable, which
// is why they are gated rather than flushed.
//   AND THE FLUSH IS THE GRID'S ALONE — no `healPoison()` at the end of `process()`. Law 8a(a) says the
//   poison half of a flush runs at the end of every call as well, and for an AUDIO path that is right: a
//   NaN's only quality is how soon it goes, and law 8a explicitly stops promising invariance "once a
//   filter has overflowed" (`docs/DSP-ARCHITECTURE.md:162`). A READ-ONLY INSTRUMENT trades the other way.
//   Recovery timed by the call boundary would make the samples after an overflow a function of where the
//   caller cut, so the set of DAMAGED hops — a published quantity — would stop being a property of the
//   programme. Grid-only recovery is bounded by 64 samples, lands on the same absolute sample under every
//   slicing, and every sample it fails to save is gated and counted anyway. The deviation is deliberate,
//   and `eq::Crossover2::resetChannel()` (`Crossover2.h:36`) is likewise never called: a channel that
//   stops being fed is handed the silence it is receiving (law 11a), because clearing its four columns
//   would put the caller's channel-count timeline into the filter state.
//
// LAW 8a — THE REPORT IS BIT-IDENTICAL UNDER ARBITRARY RE-SLICING. Same input bits, same parameters, same
// binary, and the same per-sample map of which channels are present: every field of the report and every
// hop of the trace is bit-for-bit the same however the caller cuts the stream into `process()` calls.
// What buys it: one integer clock (`totalSamples_`), the sample loop OUTSIDE and the channel loop INSIDE
// (the other order sums the shared hop accumulator as c0i0 c0i1 c1i0 c1i1 on one call and c0i0 c1i0 c0i1
// c1i1 on two — different order, different bits), hop boundaries from a counted `nextHopEnd_` and never
// from `pos % hop`, a baseline that is a selection rather than a sum, thresholds turned into ratios once
// in `prepare()` so no logarithm takes part in a decision, and denormal maintenance clocked by
// `core::StateGrid` — never at the end of `process()`, which is wherever the CALLER chose to cut.
// `maxBlock` sizes nothing at all and may not select a window, a hop or a branch.
//   WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED, precisely. (1) Bit-identity ACROSS platforms, toolchains or contraction modes.
//   The tree builds with `-ffp-contract=on` and the wasm tier with `off`; inside `Svf::processSample`
//   `a1*ic1 + a2*v3` is a contractible form with a 53-bit `a1`, so a band sample can differ between rows
//   by a fused multiply-add. Every product this file forms is nevertheless STORED before it is added, per
//   law 10's blanket pin (`analysis::StereoSums::add`, `StereoColumns.h:35`) — a product of two float32s
//   is exact in double and could not have fused into a different number, but the rule reads "every
//   product" so that nobody has to re-derive which ones are safe. (2) A channel-count timeline is the
//   caller's, not the audio's (`StateGrid.h:34`): re-slicing must preserve which channels are present at
//   each absolute sample, and "omit channel 1" is a different programme from "feed channel 1 zeros".
//   (3) WAS a caveat about `enterDb`/`exitDb` becoming ratios through `std::pow`, which is not correctly
//   rounded on every libm, so a 1-ulp difference could move a hop sitting exactly on the threshold. Since
//   v0.33.0 they go through `core::det::pow10` instead, which IS the same function on every row — and it
//   mattered more than it looked: over the dB range these thresholds live in, 41 % of `std::pow(10, x)`
//   results differ between Apple's libm and both Linux ones (measured). A threshold that moves by an ulp
//   does not move a number by an ulp; it flips a decision.
//
// FORM. setParams / prepare / process / finish / reset, the shape of `analysis::ClipDetector`. Every
// parameter takes effect at the next `prepare()`. `prepare()` disarms, validates, sizes itself through
// the public `storageFor()` and only then allocates (law 11d); `process()` and `finish()` allocate
// nothing. `finish()` is idempotent, closes an open event at coordinate T, publishes the uncovered tail
// as a number, and freezes the report; `process()` refuses until `reset()`.
