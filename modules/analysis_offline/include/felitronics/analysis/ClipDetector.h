//==============================================================================
// felitronics::analysis::ClipDetector — finds SAMPLE CLIPPING in delivered audio: the runs of samples whose peaks hit
// a ceiling and became FLAT, with their positions per channel, plus the sample peak and DC offset of each channel.
//
// WHAT CLIPPING IS, AND THE TWO THINGS THAT FOLLOW. A clamp replaces the top of every excursion past its ceiling with
// the ceiling itself, so the file carries runs of equal samples where a smooth signal would have kept moving. Hence:
//   · FLATNESS, NOT LOUDNESS. Consecutive loud samples are not evidence — a full-scale sine and a master normalised to
//     0 dBFS have them and are clean. Nothing here compares a sample with full scale.
//   · LEVEL-FREE. Clipped and then turned down is still clipped: the flat tops moved down. The ceiling is found where
//     the flat tops are, at whatever level, per channel and per polarity.
//
// THE RULE. Per channel, the stream is cut into BANDS — maximal runs of finite samples whose range is <= tau = 2q.
// q is the file's quantum as far as the stream has shown it: the smaller of the smallest non-zero step between adjacent
// samples and the coarsest 2^-k grid (k <= 24) every sample lies on — integer PCM sits on its grid exactly. Neither can
// fall below the true quantum, so tau never under-estimates the rounding a flat top carries (2q admits TPDF dither of
// ±1 LSB), and both only shrink as the stream goes on, so an early decision is the cautious one. A band of
// L >= 2 samples whose known neighbours both lie below it is a TOP (both above: a FLOOR); a side that borders a
// non-finite sample or the stream edge is unknown and is not used. A top/floor that no finite sample within ±20 ms
// passes by more than tau is a candidate, and it is a clipped run on either of two kinds of evidence:
//
//   RAMP — the flat top itself proves the clamp, so both its sides must be known (a side at a hole or at the stream edge
//     proves nothing: a signal cut into trailing digital silence is not a clamp) and all of these must hold:
//     (1) THE SMOOTH-CREST BOUND. A parabolic crest that stays inside a band of width tau for L samples cannot ENTER
//         it faster than V(L) = (tau + q)·((L+1)/(L−1))² + q: held within tau over L samples its curvature is
//         <= 8·tau/(L−1)², so the sample outside sits at most that curvature × (L+1)²/8 lower, rounding (q) included on
//         both ends. The bound is per side and the centred crest is its worst case, so one fast side would already be
//         inconsistent with a parabola; both are asked for, as margin against crests that are not parabolas (asking
//         one side only finds 5 more grid-locked pure tones of 426 clamped synthetic signals and, at the final bounds,
//         no false run — an option, not taken).
//     (2) THE CHANCE BOUND. Noise-like material (hats, snare, dither) is not a smooth crest: its samples can land inside
//         a band by coincidence. With flank activity sigma — the mean |step| over up to 8 steps before the entry and 8
//         after the exit, SKIPPING every step that touches this band's own level, because a step onto or along the
//         ceiling is the clamp, not the signal's activity — the chance that L samples fall inside the band's actual
//         range r is ~ ((r + q)/sigma)^(L−1); it must be <= 1e-6 (evaluated by multiplication, not logarithms, so no libm
//         decides a verdict and every tier agrees). The bound is set on REAL recordings, where it is
//         tight: over 72 clean files made from 18 full-length tracks and stems (16 bit at 0, −12 and −24 dB from the
//         peak, 24 bit at −6 dB) the false runs number 434 / 135 / 19 / 1 / 0 / 0 at 1e-2 / 1e-3 / 1e-4 / 1e-5 / 1e-6 /
//         1e-7, while 52 minutes of synthetic programme were clean already at 1e-3. 1e-6 is one decade past the last
//         false run (one run, in a stem whose history is not known); 1e-7 would buy a second decade for 0.2 % of the
//         runs of length 2, 5 % of a dithered clamp's runs, and three of the six files driven less than 1 dB over the
//         ceiling that 1e-6 finds. The skip is what keeps a click in digital
//         silence and a one-sample pulse on a flat baseline out: counted, their single spike made a flat stretch look
//         like a clamp; skipped, they have no activity at all.
//     (3) NOT A STEP FROM REST. A square wave, a PWM or a sample-and-hold staircase arrives at its flat top by a jump
//         from ANOTHER flat top; a clamp is approached by a signal that is moving. A flat pair among the two samples
//         before the entry (after the exit) at a level other than this band's means a step, and a step is no ramp.
//         This is the whole answer to "why is a square wave not clipped": by itself its flat tops are never evidence.
//         Its limit is honest, too — a clamp driven so hard that it swings from one ceiling to the other in <= 2
//         samples IS that square wave, and no local feature can separate the two (one PCM, two histories).
//     (4) A BAND THAT IS NOT EXACTLY FLAT MUST BE MET BY A LINE, NOT BY A TURN. Bound (1) is for parabolas, and real
//         crests are often flatter — bass through an amp, a compressor, a saturator — and enter a 1–2-quantum band
//         faster than V(L). What separates them is the approach: a crest TURNS at its top, so going outward its steps
//         grow — by 2/(2n+1) for a parabola whose apex is n samples in, by more for a flatter one; a clamp is reached by
//         a signal still moving, whose steps barely change. On each side, over the three samples outside,
//         (step2 − step1)/step1 must be <= 0.4. Measured on the real recordings above: the false runs that passed
//         (1)–(3) turned by 0.58–1.38, the ramps of clamps by −0.15 at the median and <= 0.48 for 90 % of them; at the
//         final chance bound this test is what keeps six runs in one clean bass stem out (at 1e-5 it removed 18 of 19),
//         and every threshold from 0.3 to 0.75 gives the same result. An exactly flat band (every sample equal) is what
//         an undithered clamp leaves and is exempt: shallow clamps turn like crests do, and asking it of them lost 3 of
//         84 clamped files. A dithered clamp is rough; the ramps it fails are recovered by CEILING evidence.
//   CEILING — once a RAMP run has fixed a channel's ceiling of that polarity, any candidate of L >= 2 at that level
//     (within tau) is clipped too: a clamp repeats its level exactly. This is what finds the short runs, the step-shaped
//     runs of hard-driven material and the halves of a run a non-finite sample split, and it cannot fire in a file that
//     never produced a ramp. It looks forward only: the few runs of a polarity that come before its first ramp are missed.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE, AND SAYS SO. A single clamped sample has no flat top (a run of 1 is found only by accident).
// A clamp that a lossy codec, a resampler, a post-clip filter or added noise has since reshaped is no longer flat, and
// flatness is the evidence; the fraction lost is measured and published with the module (CHANGELOG), not hidden: AAC,
// MP3 and resampling after a clamp leave 0 % of its runs findable, noise after a 16-bit clamp 96 % at ±1 LSB, 50 % at
// ±2 and none from ±4. A pure tone locked to the sample grid can hide its clamp: the stream never shows it a slow step,
// so q stays loose (music has slow places). Soft saturation
// is not a clamp. True peak is a different quantity (analysis::TruePeakMeter): a file can be over 0 dBTP with no
// clipped sample and clipped with every sample under −6 dBFS. And measurement::PeakClip — a capture-gating probe with
// its own threshold — is unrelated.
//
// FORM. prepare / process / reset / finish. process() is READ-ONLY and allocates nothing; its result is a function of
// the samples alone, bit-identical under any slicing of the stream into calls (a per-sample state machine, frame by
// frame). A decision is made 20 ms of audio after a run ends (the neighbourhood it must not exceed), so finish() is
// called once at the end of the stream to decide the last runs; after it the report is final and process() refuses
// until reset(). Non-finite samples are holes: they break a run, count in nonFiniteSamples(), and are never part of a
// peak, a DC or a decision. A channel not fed by a call that carries samples (index >= nch, law 11a) is a hole for
// those samples too. The run list holds up to ClipDetectorParams::maxRuns entries (set before prepare()); every count
// keeps counting past it and runsComplete() says whether the list is whole.
