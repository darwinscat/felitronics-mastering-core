//==============================================================================
// felitronics::analysis::LowEnd — the two questions a LACQUER asks of a master's bottom end:
//
//   1. HOW WIDE IS THE BASS. A cutter head writes the mono sum LATERALLY and the difference VERTICALLY.
//      Vertical modulation is what lifts the stylus out of the groove, so out-of-phase low end is not a
//      matter of taste — the cut either survives it or it does not. This half splits the programme at
//      `crossoverHz` with an LR4 (eq::Crossover2), forms Mid/Side, and reports the SIDE share of the low
//      band's energy: over absolute 10 ms blocks, as a duration-weighted distribution, and integrated.
//   2. WHICH NOTE OWNS THE BOTTOM. 30..300 Hz folded to semitone bands, each band's energy in the
//      cuttable (Mid) and the vertical (Side) axis, the loudest band, and how far it stands above the
//      rest. A cutting engineer's first question about a dominant bass note is whether it is LATERAL,
//      and that falls out of the same table.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES TO SAY. Nothing here is a verdict. The tonic of the key IS normally the loudest note
// in the bass — that is music, not a defect. A kick's fundamental is not a note at all and sits in the
// same bins; it is reported as the band it lands in, and nothing calls it wrong. Every threshold in
// this file DEFINES the instrument (a crossover frequency, a note range, a reference pitch) and is a
// named parameter with a documented default; no number in the report reads as good or bad.
//
// THE PUBLISHED WIDTH NUMBER IS A FRACTION, NOT A RATIO. The request was "Side-to-Mid energy ratio",
// and that ratio cannot be a number: L = -R is a real master (and the worst one for a lacquer), it
// makes Mid EXACTLY zero, and S/M is then +inf. So the report publishes both raw energies and the
// bounded SIDE ENERGY FRACTION f = S/(M+S) in [0, 1], which is monotone in r = S/M (f = r/(1+r)) and
// therefore orders programmes identically with no pole. r = f/(1-f) is one line away for a consumer
// that wants it. The scale: f = 0 is a mono bottom (perfectly lateral), f = 0.5 is a hard-panned OR an
// uncorrelated bottom (equal lateral and vertical energy — the fraction cannot tell those two apart;
// analysis::CorrelationMeter can), f = 1 is pure anti-phase, i.e. pure vertical.
//   * a MONO programme is not 0/0. Its Side is exactly 0 and its Mid is positive, so f is exactly 0 and
//     `widthValid()` is true — zero width is the RIGHT answer, not "undefined".
//   * A ZERO-ENERGY LOW BAND is the 0/0, and there a zero would lie, so it does not get one:
//     `widthReason() == NoEnergy`. Digital silence is the obvious case but NOT the only one: eq::Svf
//     keeps its state in FLOAT, so a programme below that state's own floor filters to exact zero even
//     though its raw energy is positive — measured, every sample at 2^-149 gives rawMidEnergy 2^-281
//     and lowMidEnergy exactly 0. NoEnergy therefore means "no energy reached the low band", which is
//     what the field can honestly claim; rawMidEnergy() is published beside it so the two are
//     distinguishable.
// NOTE this is an ENERGY fraction. `analysis::StereoSums::width` (StereoColumns.h:59) is an AMPLITUDE
// fraction, sqrt(S)/(sqrt(M)+sqrt(S)); it is a bit-exact port of a JavaScript spec and stays as it is.
// The amplitude form is the more sensitive of the two at small side levels (at S/M = -20 dB it reads
// 0.091 where the energy fraction reads 0.0099); both raw energies are published, so either is derivable.
//
// THE LOW BAND IS LR4-SHAPED, NOT A BRICK WALL, and the numbers say how much that matters. The LR4
// low-pass power response is |H|^2 = 1/(1+r^4)^2 with r = tan(pi*f/fs)/tan(pi*fc/fs) (the SVF's
// prewarped ratio, Svf.h:61 — NOT f/fc, which is the analogue prototype and is wrong near Nyquist).
// At fc = 120 Hz / 48 kHz that is -6.0 dB at 120 Hz, -24.6 dB at 240 Hz, -49.6 dB at 480 Hz and
// -73.7 dB at 1 kHz. So a programme whose wide content reaches down to 240 Hz WILL show side energy in
// this "low band" — against an equal-energy 60 Hz mono bass that reads f ~ 0.0039, and that is the
// measurement being correct, not leaking. The high band's own Mid/Side pair is published beside the low
// one precisely so a consumer can see where the width lives.
//   * DO NOT ADD THE TWO BANDS AND EXPECT THE INPUT. LR4 sums to an ALLPASS in amplitude, so
//     |H_lp|^2 + |H_hp|^2 = (1+r^8)/(1+r^4)^2, which is 1/2 at the crossover, not 1 (Crossover2.h:18).
//     The raw (unfiltered) Mid/Side energies are published as the full-band reference instead.
//   * AND THE INTEGRAL INCLUDES THE FILTER'S OWN STARTUP. The crossover begins at sample 0 with no
//     history, and while it charges it passes content the settled filter rejects. That is honest — the
//     programme really does start there — but it DOMINATES a near-zero side fraction: measured on a 4 s
//     file of mono 82 Hz bass plus anti-phase 900 Hz, the whole-file lowSideFraction() is 1.75e-6 while
//     the SETTLED value is 5.32e-8 (the analytic prediction is 5.3212e-8, matched to four figures from
//     20 ms on) — the first 10 ms block alone holds 96.65 % of the file's entire low Side energy, and
//     the first 100 ms 97.04 %. So the
//     integral is the answer for "what is on this record", and the 10 ms SERIES is the answer for "how
//     wide is the bass where it is playing": skip the first few blocks and the two agree. Nothing is
//     dropped here on the instrument's own initiative — the coordinates are published and the consumer
//     decides.
//
// THE SEMITONE FOLD. Bands are the MIDI notes whose centre f(n) = tuningHz * 2^((n-69)/12) lies inside
// [lowNoteHz, highNoteHz]; band n spans f(n) * 2^(-1/24) .. f(n) * 2^(+1/24). A frame's bins are
// integrated into a band with FRACTIONAL edge overlap in the POWER domain — the repository's convention
// (MultiResSpectrumPane.h:405) — under that convention's own assumption, that a bin's power is uniform
// across its cell [(k-1/2)*binHz, (k+1/2)*binHz].
//   * NOT by prefix sums. The pane needs them because a display queries arbitrary overlapping bands at
//     arbitrary frequencies; here the bands are FIXED and DISJOINT, so prepare() precomputes one flat
//     (bin, weight, moment-frequency) table and a frame is a single pass over it. And the prefix form
//     cannot carry a correct FIRST MOMENT: a fractional edge cell's power sits at the midpoint of the
//     OVERLAP, not at the bin's centre, and weighting P_k by the bin centre can place a centroid
//     outside its own band (half a bin is 0.183 Hz at 2^17/48 kHz, ~10 cents at 30 Hz).
//   * ONE-SIDED, FOLDED. SpectrumFrames does not fold (bin k is bin k), so a real tone's power splits
//     between k and N-k. The weights carry a factor 2 for 0 < k < N/2 and 1 for DC and Nyquist, which
//     makes a band's energy a genuine mean-square contribution: a full-scale sine of amplitude A inside
//     one band reads A^2/2.
//     THE FULL SUM IS THE WINDOW-WEIGHTED MEAN SQUARE, AND THE TABLE IS NOT THE FULL SUM. By Parseval
//     the folded sum over EVERY bin is sum(w*x)^2 / sum(w^2) — the mean square of x weighted by w^2,
//     published as frameEnergy(). Disjoint bands add up to that only if they COVER the spectrum, and the
//     published table covers [lowNoteHz, highNoteHz] alone: at the default range and 48 kHz that is
//     1.1345 % of Nyquist, so totalBandEnergy() is the energy of the NOTE RANGE and not of the frame.
//     bandRangeShare() is the ratio, and on a flat spectrum it equals exactly that covered fraction.
//   * RESOLUTION IS THE OBSERVATION LENGTH, and the default is the smallest order that has any. A
//     semitone at 30 Hz is 1.73 Hz wide; a Hann main lobe is 4 bins. At 48 kHz only fftOrder >= 17
//     (0.366 Hz bins, 4.87 bins per band) fits the lobe inside the band, and a tone at a band centre
//     then keeps 99.96 % of its power in its own band (measured against a direct DFT). Orders below
//     that do not resolve the bottom of the range and `underResolvedBands()` counts them rather than
//     hiding it. Zero-padding would not help: it interpolates a peak, it does not separate two tones.
//   * A TRANSIENT'S BAND ENERGY IS MODULATED UP TO 3.01 dB BY WHERE IT FALLS ON THE FRAME GRID. At the
//     default 50 % hop a click at a frame boundary is weighted w^2 = 1 by one frame and 0 by the next,
//     while a click a quarter-window later is weighted 0.5^2 by each of two frames: 1 against 0.5, or
//     exactly 3.0103 dB, over the same frame count. Hann is COLA at 50 % overlap for the WINDOW, not for
//     its square, so no hop choice removes this. It is deterministic and absolute — the grid does not
//     move with the caller's slicing, so law 8a is untouched — but it means the band energy of the click
//     half of a kick carries up to 3 dB of grid phase, and a consumer comparing two transient-heavy
//     programmes should know it. Steady tones are unaffected (they are present in every frame).
//   * WHAT STILL SPREADS IS THE BAND EDGE. A tone near a semitone boundary splits roughly 50/50 between
//     two bands, depressing the peak and raising its neighbour. The whole band table is published, so a
//     split is visible; the peak's centroid recovers a tuning offset well inside the band (true 10/20/30
//     cents read 10.0/19.9/28.6 at B0) and compresses toward the centre as it approaches +-50 cents.
//     It is a spectral centroid, not a tuner.
//   * THE SEMITONE GRID HAS A TILT, AND IT IS NAMED. Band width grows with frequency, so under a FLAT
//     spectrum the top band of the default range holds 3.17x (5.02 dB) the energy of the median band
//     with no note present at all. That is why the background is a median of DENSITIES (energy per Hz)
//     scaled to the peak band's width — under white noise that reads 1.0, as it should — and why the
//     argmax is published twice: `peakBand()` maximises ENERGY (what a tone does, since a tone's energy
//     is independent of its band's width) and `peakDensityBand()` maximises DENSITY (what noise does).
//     When the two disagree, the bottom end is noise-like rather than tonal, and that is evidence.
//   * AND A RANGE THAT HOLDS ONLY ROUND-OFF HOLDS NOTHING. Pure DC, pure Nyquist and a signal at the
//     float denormal floor all leave the 30..300 Hz table with a POSITIVE total that is pure transform
//     round-off: measured, DC gives a bandRangeShare of 1.3e-34 and Nyquist 1.9e-38, and `> 0` alone
//     then named F#3 as the dominant note of a signal that has no note at all. A double FFT resolves a
//     bin to about 1e-15 of the largest bin in amplitude, i.e. 1e-30 in power, so a share at or below
//     kNoteFloorShare = 1e-24 is the transform's own floor — six decades above it, and twenty-seven
//     below the 1.1e-7 a single impulse produces. Below it the answer is NoEnergy and a reason, not a
//     note. This is a threshold that DEFINES the instrument's resolution, published as a constant with
//     its derivation, not a verdict on the programme.
//   * THE DOMINANCE RATIO IS NOT A STORED FIELD, for the same reason S/M is not: the median energy of a
//     synthetic tone in digital silence is exactly 0 and the ratio is then +inf. The report publishes
//     `peakBandEnergy()`, `backgroundDensity()` and `peakBandWidthHz()` — divide them if you want it —
//     plus the bounded `peakShare()` = peak / total, and the runner-up band, which is what says whether
//     the "dominant" note has a rival (a split tone, or a two-note bass).
//
// THE PAIR IS CHANNEL 0 AND CHANNEL 1, AND NOTHING ELSE. L = channel 0, R = channel 1, or R = L for a
// mono object. Channels 2.. take no part in either half: this is an L/R lacquer instrument, and letting
// a surround or LFE channel decide the dominant note (or poison a frame) would measure a record nobody
// is cutting. `analysedChannels()` says so out loud.
//
// FORM (law 11d): setParams / prepare / process / finish / reset, every entry point [[nodiscard]] bool,
// and a public `Storage` + `storageFor()` published from the function prepare() sizes itself with.
// prepare() allocates; process() and finish() do not. OFFLINE (message thread): the default parameters
// ask the heap for ~7 MB.
//
// LAW 8a — bit-identical under ARBITRARY re-slicing, which is stronger than law 11(a)'s same-boundaries
// promise (DSP-ARCHITECTURE.md:273). One integer clock; the outer loop is over SAMPLES and the inner over
// channels; `maxBlock` sizes nothing at all; the 10 ms grid and the frame schedule are absolute; the
// denormal flush rides core::StateGrid rather than the end of process() (eq::Crossover2 does NOT run
// that cadence itself — Crossover2.h:58 hands `flushDenormals()` to its owner); and THE TAIL IS NOT
// TRANSFORMED — finish() invents no spectral frame and publishes `tailUncoveredSamples()` instead, while
// the time-domain half covers every sample up to T and closes its one partial block at [floor(T/B)*B, T).
