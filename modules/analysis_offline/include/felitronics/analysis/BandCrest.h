//==================================================================================================
// felitronics::analysis::BandCrest — the peak-to-RMS of a programme, per 400 ms block and per band.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. An automatic mastering mode needs a MICRO-DYNAMICS damage counter: run this on the input,
// run it again on the delivered output, and the damage is the crest a band LOST, block by block. Macro damage
// is LRA (it exists); timbre is a band energy shift (it does not yet); this is the third counter.
//
// WHAT A BAND CREST CAN AND CANNOT MEAN. It is the peak-to-RMS of the signal seen through a NAMED filter. It is
// never a statement about "the content between 2 and 6 kHz": the band is a dome, and an LR4 skirt is only
// 24 dB/octave down, so a band's peak can be a neighbour's transient leaking in. In the DIFFERENCE of two runs
// through the SAME filter that leakage largely cancels; in one run's absolute number it does not, and this
// header says so rather than letting a reader assume otherwise.
//
//==================================================================================================
// THE FOUR DECISIONS, and each one is a place where the obvious choice is wrong
//==================================================================================================
//
// 1. RECONSTRUCTED PEAK, NOT SAMPLE PEAK — and the reason is not the sample rate. Even with both runs on the
//    SAME grid, a sample peak is biased in ONE direction: the input carries inter-sample peaks and the output
//    has been through a true-peak limiter whose whole job is to remove them. A sample-peak crest would
//    under-read the input's crest and therefore UNDER-REPORT the loss — the one number this class exists to
//    produce. The reconstruction is the certifying instrument's own: 4x, 32 taps per phase, the same
//    `oversampling::PolyphaseOversampler` topology `ReferenceTruePeakMeter` is built from, so the full-band
//    peak this class reports can be nulled against the certificate rather than merely believed.
//
// 2. ONE RECONSTRUCTION, THEN THE SPLIT AT 4x — not a split at the base rate followed by five
//    reconstructions. It is cheaper (one interpolation instead of five) and it makes the band magnitudes
//    nearly rate-independent as a side effect: an LR4 corner is prewarped by `tan(pi*f/fs)`, so at the base
//    rate the skirt one octave out moves with the sample rate, and a comparison across a delivery resampler
//    would read that movement as damage.
//
// 3. THE BANDS ARE INDEPENDENT FILTERS OF THE INPUT, not a reconstructing tree:
//
//        low     = LP4(f0)
//        lowMid  = HP4(f0) -> LP4(f1)
//        highMid = HP4(f1) -> LP4(f2)
//        high    = HP4(f2)
//        full    = the reconstructed stream itself
//
//    A serial tree (`eq::MultibandSplitter`) is cheaper and sums back to the input, but it pays for that with
//    ALLPASS compensation on every band — and an allpass changes the waveform, which is to say it changes the
//    PEAK, which is to say it changes the very quantity being measured. Nothing here ever needs the bands to
//    sum, so nothing here pays for summing. The bands do NOT reconstruct the input and are not meant to: at an
//    LR crossover both branches sit at 1/2 amplitude and their powers sum to 1/2, not to 1.
//
// 4. THE ACTIVITY MASK IS BUILT FROM THE INPUT ONLY. This is the decision that can quietly invalidate
//    everything else. A mask computed on each side separately, or on the output, can drop exactly the blocks
//    the chain damaged most — a loud block that the chain crushed may fall below a gate the input version
//    passed, and the damage then leaves the population along with it. So the consumer builds ONE mask, on the
//    source, and applies it to both sides; this class publishes the mask and its counts so that the population
//    behind a number is visible rather than assumed.
//
//    The gate itself is a CONJUNCTION, because each half alone fails in its own direction:
//      * an absolute programme floor (default -70 dBFS on the full band) — without it a quiet passage is
//        judged, and a relative loudness gate would throw away exactly the quiet passages where a compressor
//        does its work;
//      * a band SHARE floor (default -40 dB of the full band's energy) — without it a band with no content
//        contributes the crest of its own noise floor, and an input that is digital black in a band against an
//        output carrying dither reads as several dB of "damage" that is nothing of the kind.
//    Share is level-invariant, so it does not drop a quiet passage's minor bands the way an absolute band
//    floor would.
//
//==================================================================================================
// TIME, EXACTLY
//==================================================================================================
// The hop grid is `LoudnessMeter`'s, and it is built the way that meter builds it — out of `kSubHopsPerHop`
// sub-hops of `lround(0.01*fs)` samples, not by rounding the whole hop. The two agree wherever `0.01*fs` is an
// integer and part where it is not: at 22050 Hz a rounded hop is 2205 samples and the meter's is 2210. A block
// is `blockHops` hops (400 ms at the defaults), one block every hop once the first `blockHops` are in, so
// block j covers input samples [j*H, (j+blockHops)*H) and block j of one run pairs with block j of another.
//
// WITH ONE NAMED DIFFERENCE: this analyzer closes the hop the programme ENDS INSIDE and the meter does not, so
// on a programme that does not end on a hop boundary there is one more block here. That is deliberate — the
// last hop is the end of the file, and a master's loudest material often sits there — and it is stated rather
// than left for a consumer to discover from a count that is one off.
//
// THE INTERPOLATOR'S DELAY IS HALF AN OVERSAMPLED SAMPLE, and it is named rather than rounded away in silence.
// The polyphase FIR is symmetric over `factor*tapsPerPhase` oversampled taps, so its group delay is
// `(factor*tapsPerPhase - 1)/2` of them — MEASURED, not assumed: an impulse at base index 64 comes back
// symmetric about oversampled index 319.5, bit for bit (the suite pins it). With the shipped 4x/32 that is
// 63.5 oversampled samples. The integer part is skipped exactly; the remaining half sample is 5.2 microseconds
// at 48 kHz, 13 parts per million of a 400 ms block, and it is the same half sample on both sides of any
// comparison.
//
//==================================================================================================
// WHAT IS STORED, AND WHY IT IS LINEAR
//==================================================================================================
// One cell per hop per band: the reconstructed PEAK (linear) and the sum of squares. Blocks are derived when
// read — a block's peak is the max of its hops' peaks and its mean square the sum over its hops — and dB is a
// VIEW taken with one `core::det::log10` at the end. Storing dB would put a logarithm in the store and lose
// the one property the comparison needs: formed from linear cells, a crest LOSS is
// `20*log10((peakA*rmsB)/(rmsA*peakB))`, one logarithm and invariant to any gain applied to either side.
//
// Ten minutes at the defaults is 6000 hops x 5 bands x 16 B = 469 KB. It is not reduced online, and cannot be:
// the loss is a per-cell difference between two runs, and no single run can form it.
//==================================================================================================

// THE PAIRED COMPARISON — what this analyzer exists to produce. A per-run crest table is descriptive; the DAMAGE is the
// crest a band lost between the source and the master, block by block.
//
// THE POPULATION IS THE SOURCE'S MASK, and only the source's. A mask taken from the output, or from both, can
// drop exactly the blocks the chain damaged most: a loud block the chain crushed can fall below a gate its
// input passed, and the damage then leaves the population with it. So the caller passes the source as `in` and
// the master as `out`, and the mask comes from `in` alone.
//
// THE LOSS IS ONE LOGARITHM OF A RATIO OF LINEAR CELLS:
//
//     loss(j) = 10*log10( (peakIn^2 * meanSqOut) / (peakOut^2 * meanSqIn) )
//
// which is `crestIn - crestOut` written so that no pair of dB values is subtracted. It is INVARIANT to any gain
// applied to either side — a master is louder than its source by construction, and a loss that moved with the
// gain would measure the gain.
//
// FOUR NUMBERS, NOT ONE, and the reason is that the obvious one is blind to the instrument doing the damage.
// A limiter works on the loudest few percent of blocks. If 4 % of the blocks lose 6 dB of crest, the p95 of the
// positive part reads ZERO — the statistic is 0 exactly where the damage is concentrated. So:
//   * `cvar95` — the mean of the worst 5 % — is the number that sees concentrated damage, and is meant to be
//     the one a cost function reads;
//   * `p95` stays beside it, because it is what a reader expects and its disagreement with `cvar95` is itself
//     the signal that the damage is concentrated;
//   * `over1Db` / `over3Db` / `over6Db` count the blocks past each threshold, which is the same fact as a count
//     rather than a quantile;
//   * `p5` is the NEGATIVE side, and it is not symmetry for its own sake: a limiter that pulls a kick down for
//     tens of milliseconds lowers a band's RMS while its peak elsewhere in the block is untouched, so the crest
//     RISES. Clipped to its positive part that damage is invisible; `p5` is where it shows.
//
// A crest loss with no PEAK loss is a floor RISE, not a flattening — a clipper putting a steady harmonic into a
// band that held only a click reads the same way here. The band's own peak and mean-square shifts are published
// so a consumer can tell the two apart rather than attribute both to micro-dynamics.
