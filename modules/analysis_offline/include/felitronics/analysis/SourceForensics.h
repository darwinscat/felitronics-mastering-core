//==============================================================================
// felitronics::analysis::SourceForensics — WHAT THE FILE ACTUALLY WAS, as far as the samples can prove it.
// Two families of evidence, nothing else, and NO attribution:
//
//   1. THE SPECTRAL WALL. A long-term (Welch) mean power spectrum, then the sharp upper edge in it: where
//      it is (in Hz AND as a fraction of this rate's Nyquist), how deep the drop is, how wide the
//      transition is, and separately how far up the spectrum is EMPTY (the upsampling tell).
//   2. THE SAMPLE GRID. Per sample, no FFT: the coarsest dyadic grid 2^-k every finite sample lies on, and
//      how many distinct sample values the stream carries.
//
// WHAT THIS INSTRUMENT REFUSES TO DO. It never says "this is an MP3", "this is upsampled", "this is really
// 16-bit". It publishes coordinates and continuous evidence; the thresholds it does carry are the ones that
// DEFINE the measurement (what counts as a sharp edge, what counts as empty, how wide a plateau is
// sampled), each a named parameter with a documented default. Where the evidence does not reach, the answer
// is `valid = false` plus a reason — never a number that reads as "nothing found".
//
// THE TWO WAYS A NAIVE VERSION OF THIS LIES CONFIDENTLY, and what is done about them:
//
//   · A BAND LIMIT IS A SUFFIX PROPERTY, NOT A LOCAL ONE. The obvious construction — find the steepest
//     local descent, then measure the level just above it — reports a deep NOTCH as a wall: a band-stop, a
//     comb filter or a room null gives a 100 dB "drop" and a one-cell "transition" while full-power
//     spectrum resumes 400 Hz higher. Worse, the notch WINS the search and the real wall above it is then
//     never even evaluated. So the floor of the drop here is `maxAbove` — the loudest cell ANYWHERE above
//     the candidate (a suffix maximum) — and the search maximises that conservative drop. A notch scores
//     ~0 dB because the spectrum comes back; a genuinely band-limited file scores its whole depth. The
//     drop against the LOCAL floor is published beside it as `localDropDb`, and their difference — how far
//     the spectrum comes BACK above the edge — as `recoveryDb`. This also settles the gentle-rolloff case without any special
//     rule: on a monotone 10 dB/kHz slope the loudest cell above a boundary is the cell right at it, so the
//     drop is ~10 dB and the edge is simply not sharp.
//     A suffix MAXIMUM is a blunt instrument, though: one narrow sustained line above the edge — a 19 kHz
//     switching whine, a leaked pilot tone — would be the loudest thing above it and would collapse the
//     drop of a real wall to nothing, and then the argmax moves to an unrelated boundary and publishes ITS
//     frequency. Measured on a -9 dB/octave programme walled at 16 kHz: one 19 kHz line at -45 dB relative
//     to the midband is already louder than the 15 kHz cell, and the reported cutoff jumps from 16 kHz to
//     2.5 kHz. Two guards, and both are needed: the search runs on a 3-cell MEDIAN-FILTERED copy of the
//     cells, and the floor is not the suffix maximum but the (t+1)-th LARGEST cell of the suffix, where
//     t forgives at most `exemptCells` cells and never more than a tenth of the suffix — so the exemption
//     self-disables near Nyquist, where the suffix is short and no forgiveness is wanted. The line is
//     never lost: `sufMaxPower` and `strictDropDb` publish the unforgiven numbers, `exemptedCells` says
//     how many cells were skipped, `recoveryDb` is measured from the STRICT maximum, and the "empty above"
//     test runs on per-BIN maxima and sees every line.
//   · AN EDGE THAT IS NOT THERE MUST NOT BE GIVEN A FREQUENCY. A monotone-falling full-band spectrum has
//     its largest plateau-to-suffix ratio at the LOWEST candidate, because a plateau span fixed in Hz
//     spans 1.6 octaves at 1.3 kHz and 0.19 at 16 kHz; a flat one has it at the highest, where the suffix
//     is shortest. Either way an argmax always returns something. So `minDropDb` is not only a
//     post-hoc flag: a report whose best descent does not reach it is `valid = false`, reason
//     `ShallowerThanMinDrop`, with every number still published as evidence. Measured margin: on white
//     noise the largest drop an argmax can find over 482 candidates is 1.7 dB at one frame and 0.6 dB at
//     sixteen, against a 24 dB default — estimator noise cannot manufacture an edge.
//     Hence three deliberately different resolutions, each published: the edge geometry at cell
//     resolution on median-filtered cells, the emptiness at bin resolution on raw means, and
//     `peakCellPower` — the reference the emptiness threshold hangs from — as the loudest RAW cell. That
//     reference is published, and it needs to be: a louder one raises the threshold and makes emptiness
//     EASIER to claim, and a cell being a 17-bin mean does not stop a dominant tone from setting it.
//   · A POSITION NEAR NYQUIST CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED. A wall at 0.9-0.95 of Nyquist is where a converter's
//     or an export's anti-alias filter sits, where a 320 kbit/s codec sits, and where a genuinely
//     band-limited master sits. That band is ambiguous BY NATURE, so `nearNyquist` marks it and the
//     instrument stops there. (At 44.1 kHz the default 0.80 is 17.6 kHz and at 48 kHz 19.2 kHz, while
//     128 kbit/s at 16 kHz is 0.73 / 0.67 and stays below it.) `nearNyquist == false` is NOT a claim that
//     something compressed the file: a deliberate 16 kHz low-pass is always possible, and this instrument
//     cannot tell the two apart either. It reports the number.
//
// WHAT THE SAMPLE GRID CAN AND CANNOT PROVE. `gridExponent` k is a fact about the float stream AS IT
// ARRIVED: every finite sample is an exact multiple of 2^-k. From it, `minExactPcmBits = k + 1` is the
// SHORTEST normalised PCM word that holds every observed sample exactly — values i/2^(b-1) for integer i in
// [-2^(b-1), 2^(b-1) - 1], so the admissible range is [-1, +1): -1 is a PCM sample and +1 is not.
// Read it in that direction only:
//   · It does NOT bound the source's word length from above. A 24-bit file carrying a 16-bit master padded
//     with zeros is indistinguishable from a 16-bit file — that is the whole point of the measurement, and
//     also its limit: the coarse grid is always compatible with storage on a finer one.
//   · The ABSENCE of zero low bits proves nothing at all. 16-bit dithered up into 24, or normalised by a
//     non-dyadic gain, fills the low bits and reports "<= 24 bits" (or no PCM grid at all), which is the
//     honest answer, not "24 bits, really".
//   · A grid finer than 2^-23 is not a PCM word this measurement will name: `pcmCompatible = false`,
//     reason `FinerThan24BitGrid`. A decoded lossy file, anything through a float gain, and 32-bit PCM all
//     land there — a NON-DYADIC gain does, at least; an exactly dyadic one (x0.5) leaves the stream on a
//     perfectly good, one-bit-finer grid. 32-bit PCM lands there at EVERY level, measured: float32's top
//     binade [0.5, 1) is spaced 2^-24, one
//     bit finer than a 24-bit grid, so near full scale a 32-bit stream reads k = 24 and lower down k = 31.
//     What DOES read as 24-bit is a 32-bit CONTAINER carrying 24-bit content (every code a multiple of
//     256): k = 23, and a container carrying 16-bit content reads k = 15. Container and content are
//     different questions and only the content is in the samples. (io::Wav decodes 32-bit PCM to double
//     and keeps what a float32 path here would have discarded — see io/Wav.h.)
//   · A sample OUTSIDE [-1, +1) fits no normalised PCM word at any depth — a b-bit word carries
//     i/2^(b-1) for i in [-2^(b-1), 2^(b-1) - 1], so -1 is representable and +1 is not — so
//     `outsidePcmRange` withholds `minExactPcmBits` while `gridExponent` stays valid. Exactly +1.0 is
//     therefore not a PCM word's sample, however routinely a float master's peak sits there.
//
// FORM. setParams / prepare / process / finish / reset, as analysis::ClipDetector. process() is READ-ONLY
// and allocates nothing; `maxBlock` sizes NOTHING (a report must be identical for prepare(sr, 64, nch) and
// prepare(sr, 8192, nch), and a legal call longer than maxBlock is consumed whole). One integer clock, the
// outer loop over samples and the inner over channels. Non-finite samples are holes: counted, never
// measured, never guessed — and they poison exactly the spectral frames that contain them (SpectrumFrames
// does that part). A channel a call does not carry (index >= numChannels, law 11a) is a hole for those
// samples too, counted separately. finish() closes the measurement and freezes the report; process() then
// refuses until reset().
//
// LAW 8a. With the same input bits, parameters, binary and FFT backend, every published field is
// bit-identical under ARBITRARY re-slicing of the stream into process() calls — stronger than law 11(a),
// which only promises agreement with the caller's own boundaries. Bit-exactness across platforms or FFT
// backends is NOT promised. What that costs here: one add per usable frame into a per-channel Neumaier
// per-bin accumulator in frame order; no per-call subtotals and no averaging of per-call averages; power
// averaged LINEARLY with dB taken once at the end; the aggregate spectrum rebuilt from the finished
// per-channel MEANS in ascending channel order (pooling raw sums instead would weight channels by how long
// each was present); quantiles by integer index into a freshly copied scratch, never by permuting the
// accumulator; and the whole cell/edge analysis deferred to finish(), so reading the report cannot change
// it. The capacity of the distinct-value set is published before allocation and its exhaustion is DATA
// (a count plus `distinctComplete`), never a refusal in the middle of a call.
//
// WHAT `transitionHz` CAN MEAN AT BEST. The measured width is bounded below by the analysis window's own
// skirt, so it is a property of the geometry as much as of the file. For a brickwalled passband under a
// periodic Hann window the integrated leakage past d bins falls as 1/(15*pi^2*d^5), which inverts to
//     transitionHz >= binHz * (10^(D/10) / (15*pi^2))^(1/5)        D = the drop being measured, in dB
// (verified against the exact kernel integral beyond d = 10). At fftOrder 14 / 48 kHz that is ~90 Hz for a
// 96 dB drop and ~170 Hz for 110 dB — far under the 1500 Hz default. It is NOT negligible at every legal
// setting: at fftOrder 12 a perfect brickwall over a -140 dB floor measures ~2.7 kHz and would be refused
// `sharp` by its own window. A caller who lowers fftOrder must raise maxTransitionHz with it.
//
// TWO NUMBERS THIS FILE DOES NOT INVENT. The quantile rule is NEAREST-RANK — the order statistic of
// 1-based rank ceil(q*n), clamped to [1, n] — which is the rule dynamics::offline::QuantileHistogram
// already names for this repository (Quantile.h:22), NOT analysis::LoudnessMeter's LRA rule (which takes
// the bin's LOWER bound at rank (N-1)*p + 0.5, faithful to libebur128 and correct there because LRA is a
// DIFFERENCE of two percentiles, so that half-BIN offset cancels), and NOT a third rule of its own. It is
// computed by integer arithmetic, which simply removes the question of whether ceil(q*n) in floating point
// can land on the wrong side of an integer (for these quantiles it does not, checked to n = 20000 — the
// integer form needs no such check). And every dB here is 10*log10 of a power RATIO, inline:
// core::gainToDb is an AMPLITUDE function, 20*log10 with its argument floored at 1e-12, so it would double
// every number and clamp any ratio below 1e-12 to -240 dB.
//
// WHY NO CELL CAN BE NaN, so that a sort of them is not undefined behaviour. Only hole-free frames of
// finite floats are transformed, and for those |X_k| <= N*max|x| <= 2^22 * 3.4e38, so a bin power is under
// 2e90 and the accumulated sum overflows only past ~1e200 frames. The frame producer's own hole gate is
// what keeps that true if a backend ever changes underneath.
//
// THREE THINGS A CALLER HAS TO KNOW ABOUT THE GEOMETRY IT CHOOSES.
//   · A CELL IS NEVER NARROWER THAN A BIN, so `cellWidthHz` is a request: at fftOrder 8 / 48 kHz a
//     requested 50 Hz becomes 187.5, and `cellHz()` publishes what it became. Below about fftOrder 11 at
//     48 kHz a cell IS one bin, and then the 3-cell median that protects the edge search is a 3-BIN
//     median, which cannot remove a Hann main lobe (4 bins) — measured: at fftOrder 10 a single sinusoid
//     as loud as the passband takes the search off the wall entirely, exactly the failure the median and
//     the rank exist to prevent. Read `binsPerCell()`: at 3 or more the guard holds, at 1 it does not.
//   · `searchFromHz` IS THE WEAKER OF TWO FLOORS. The lowest candidate is
//     max(plateauSpanCells, ceil(searchFromHz/cellHz)), so at the defaults the effective floor is 1992 Hz
//     set by `plateauSpanHz`, and `searchFromHz` only bites once the plateau span drops below it.
//     `searchFromHz()` publishes the floor that applies.
//   · prepare() IS noexcept AND ALLOCATES. A geometry that asks for more memory than the process can give
//     therefore terminates rather than returning false — `storageFor()` exists so a caller can ask first,
//     and at fftOrder 22 with 16 channels the answer is over a gigabyte.
//
// RT: an OFFLINE instrument (message thread). prepare() allocates; process/finish/reset do not.
