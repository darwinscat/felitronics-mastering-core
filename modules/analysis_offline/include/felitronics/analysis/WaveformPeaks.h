//==============================================================================
// felitronics::analysis::WaveformPeaks — the "bars" a waveform player draws: a whole file reduced to `buckets`
// absolute max-abs values, after a box-average decimation to about 8 kHz.
//
// THESE ARE NOT PEAKS IN ANY METERING SENSE, and the name says "waveform" for that reason. A bucket is the largest
// |mean| of ~125 µs boxes, so it does not exceed the sample peak of its stretch EXCEPT by the rounding of the box
// mean — a sequential binary64 sum divided by the box's sample count, whose error grows with the number of samples a
// box averages. A bucket read above its sample peak is that rounding, not a defect. It sits further below the true peak.
// Neither of the core's two true-peak meters is involved, and those two must not be confused with each other either:
// `analysis::ReferenceTruePeakMeter` (the 128-tap reference: what `fc_probe_tp_linear` reports and what a delivered
// ceiling is aimed with) and `analysis::TruePeakMeter` (the spec's 48-tap filter, a live meter) are DIFFERENT filters and
// read different numbers. How far apart is pinned by felitronics_truepeak_instrument_gap_tests, not stated here. A
// picture that must show a true peak next to these bars names which one it shows.
//
// THIS IS A PORT, AND THE SPEC IS EXECUTABLE: the site's `computePeaksFromBuffer` and `peaksFromWav`
// (audio-peaks.js). Before this header the same picture had four definitions — a Java sidecar generator
// decoding to 8 kHz s16, a python one, the page's JavaScript and a costume on top of the sidecars — and a demo
// file and an uploaded one could be drawn by different ones in the same interface. This is the one definition both
// roads are meant to take — the native CLI a server runs and the browser module; moving the site's generators and
// page onto it is the site's work and had not happened when this was written — and it is the JavaScript's to the bit: a cross-language NULL runs the same float32 PCM
// through both. Anything below that reads like an improvement is a change to the picture, not to this file.
//
// THE DEFINITION, step by step (the spec's variable names in brackets):
//   decim      = max(1, round(sampleRate / 8000))             JavaScript's Math.round — ties toward +infinity
//   decLen     = max(buckets, floor(frames / decim))
//   perBucket  = decLen / buckets                              [decPerBucket], a double
//   each frame → one value v by `PeakMix`; every `decim` values → one box, d = |mean| (Max: the mean itself)
//   the running max of d is emitted when the box counter reaches the bucket's boundary (bucket + 1) · perBucket
// Everything is binary64 in the spec's order — a sample is promoted to double before it is touched — so the
// arithmetic here IS the arithmetic there, and there is no product in it for FP contraction to fuse.
//
// TWO OUTPUT TYPES, BECAUSE THE SPEC HAS TWO. `computePeaksFromBuffer` stores the maxima in a plain Array, i.e.
// as doubles; `peaksFromWav` stores them in a Float32Array, i.e. rounded to float32. Same arithmetic, different
// last step, so the conversion is explicit and named: `peaks()` is the first, `peakAsFloat32()` the second. (What
// this header cannot reproduce is `peaksFromWav` on a 32-bit integer or float64 WAV: it reads those samples as
// doubles, and a float32 plane has already rounded them. That is a compatibility decision about the input, not a
// property of the reduction, and it stays outside this class.)
//
// THE SPEC'S KNOWN PROPERTIES ARE KEPT, not fixed — each is a change to the picture and each has a pinned witness:
//   * THE LAST BUCKET CAN BE LOST. The boundary is (bucket + 1) · perBucket, a product of an already rounded
//     quotient; at decLen = 2007, buckets = 1000 the last one is 2007.0000000000002, the counter tops out at
//     2007, and bucket 999 is never emitted — it reads 0.
//   * A tail shorter than one box is dropped: its frames never form a box.
//   * When floor(frames / decim) < buckets the boundaries outrun the boxes and the trailing buckets stay 0.
//   * The effective envelope rate depends on the file's rate: 44.1 kHz → decim 6 → 7350 Hz, 48 kHz → 8000 Hz.
//   * A NaN value never wins `d > max`, so a box containing one is skipped (its mean is NaN); +Inf wins. In 'max'
//     mode a NaN CHANNEL never wins `|x| > fv` either, so it reads as that frame's other channels.
//   * 'avr' divides per FRAME, channel 0 first: three channels at 16 kHz on [3f35e00d bf089722 3eb88b0a] and
//     [3ef22e5b bf11b04d bf347cf7] read 0x3fa6828cd5555556, where one division of all six samples at the end reads ...555.
//
// NOT COVERED BY PARITY, because it is runtime state (law 10): FTZ/DAZ. A subnormal sample peaks at 1.4e-45 in
// the spec and at 0 on a host thread that flushes denormals. Run with them off when the bits must match.
//
// STREAMING. `prepare()` takes the file's TOTAL length, because every boundary depends on it; a stream of
// unknown length is not supported and cannot be. `process()` may be called with any split of the file and gives
// the bits one call would — nothing here depends on where a call ends. The width is EXACT (law 11c): 'avr'
// divides by the channel count and 'R' reads the last channel, so a narrower call would be a different picture,
// and is refused. A call that would run past the prepared length is refused as a whole, before anything moves.
//
// RT-safe: prepare() is the only allocation; process() does no alloc / lock / throw.
