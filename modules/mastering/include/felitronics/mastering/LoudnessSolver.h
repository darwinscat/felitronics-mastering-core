//==============================================================================
// felitronics::mastering::TargetLoudnessSolver — hit a target integrated loudness with a stated true-peak
// ceiling, in a bounded number of renders, and REFUSE rather than crush the programme when the target
// cannot be had without breaking a named limit.
//
// ====================================================================================
// THE ONE EQUATION — why this is a scalar search and not two loops chasing each other
// ====================================================================================
// The solver owns exactly two numbers: `preLimiterGainDb` (call it g) and `limiter.ceilingDbTp` (c).
// They look like two knobs and are not, and this is the load-bearing fact of the whole class. Inside
// `limiter::TruePeakLimiter` the reduction is `rawRedDb = min(0, c - smaxDb)`, and `smaxDb` is taken on
// the signal AFTER the gain node, so `smaxDb(10^(g/20) p) = smaxDb(p) + g`. Therefore
//
//     rawRedDb = min (0, -(g - c) - smaxDb(p))
//
// depends on g and c ONLY through the difference. Write `d = g - c` (the DRIVE, in dB above the
// ceiling); the release recursion `grDb = min(rawRed, grDb*relCoef)` reads only `rawRed`, as do both envelopes of
// the limiter's `dualRelease`, so the whole gain trace is a function of d alone, and the output is
//
//     y(g, c) = 10^(c/20) * y(d, 0)
//
// i.e. c is a pure output SCALE and d is the entire SHAPE. Measured on this tree over a 3x3 grid of
// (g, c): max |y(g,c) - 10^(c/20) y(d,0)| = 9.1e-07 .. 1.7e-06 on a programme peaking at 0.89, which is
// float rounding in `dbToGain` and the FIR, not a structural gap. Consequences, and they are the design:
//
//     I(g, c)  = c + J(d)          achieved integrated loudness
//     TP(g, c) = c + T(d)          achieved true peak
//     PLR(d)   = T(d) - J(d)       peak-to-loudness — INDEPENDENT OF c
//
// WHAT THAT IS USED FOR HERE, precisely — because the identity is a REASON, not the algorithm, and an
// earlier draft of this comment described an algorithm this class does not implement. It is used for
// exactly two things:
//   * the loudness loop and the ceiling loop CANNOT chase each other, because they are not two loops.
//     Lowering the ceiling and raising the gain by the same amount leaves the limiting shape untouched,
//     so the ceiling correction is a trim rather than a competitor to the loudness correction;
//   * getting QUIETER is therefore an EXACT single step (see the step rule in solve()), with no slope
//     and no model, whenever the ceiling has room to come down with it.
// The search itself is a secant on MEASURED integrated loudness, not a closed-form inversion of `J`:
// the identity holds before the dither and while the gated block set does not move, and neither of
// those is guaranteed (the dither is after the limiter and does not scale; the absolute gate is not
// scale-invariant — see below). Every candidate is rendered and measured; the identity only ever
// chooses where to look next.
//
// `PLR(d)` being monotone non-increasing in d is measured rather than assumed — three real mixes,
// 16.53 -> 6.95, 13.17 -> 7.29 and 15.87 -> 7.34 over an 18 dB sweep, no reversal — and it is why the
// least drive that satisfies the ceiling is also the most transient the programme can keep at that
// loudness.
//
// THE DERATE IS NOT A CONSTANT HERE, and that is the point. `TruePeakLimiter` bounds its own F*fs grid
// exactly and overshoots the reconstructed peak between grid points — up to +1.22 dB in the worst
// non-degenerate case at 4x, and measured IN SITU on the corpus (with the meter it aimed with before) at only +0.0005 .. +0.1028 dB, because
// spectral tilt buys it cheaply. A fixed 1.2 dB derate would cost loudness on every track. Here the
// delivered peak is MEASURED and enters `PLR`, so the derate is whatever the material's is, on that
// material, and the ceiling that gets programmed into the limiter is an OUTPUT of the solve.
//
// ====================================================================================
// WHAT A PASS IS, and the honest cost — because the interesting claim is a cost claim
// ====================================================================================
// A PASS is one `OfflineRenderer::render` over the whole programme. `passes` in the result counts them
// and nothing else. Measured on this tree (60 s stereo, one render each), a render is NOT uniformly
// expensive: the limiter is 1417.7 ms of 1522.8, i.e. **93 %**; the dither 4 %; the EQ and the
// compressor together 3.3 %; the chain with the limiter and the dither bypassed is **3.7 %**. So a
// probe that re-runs only the limiter is not cheap, and a scheme that saves chain renders while
// running the limiter saves nothing. This class therefore minimises RENDERS, states its probe cost
// openly, and reports both numbers.
//
// ====================================================================================
// WHICH TRUE-PEAK METER, AND WHY IT IS THE EXPENSIVE ONE
// ====================================================================================
// `maxTruePeakDbTp` is a promise about the DELIVERED file, and a delivered file is certified by
// `analysis::ReferenceTruePeakMeter` — what `fcore_measure` and the browser's `fc_probe` report. So every
// render is read by that class and nothing else: the ceiling is aimed, feasibility is judged and
// `measured.truePeakDbTp` is reported on the same arithmetic the certificate runs, and the reported number
// IS the certificate — bit for bit, on the delivered samples. This class used to read with
// `analysis::TruePeakMeter`, the spec's short filter, and judged a render feasible by a number the
// certificate did not agree with: that meter stops interpolating at 2x / 1x on the high delivery rates, and
// on bright transients under-reads even at 4x. How far the two disagree is pinned by
// felitronics_truepeak_instrument_gap_tests. A wider aim margin was the alternative and was rejected: the
// disagreement depends on the material, so any margin is a guess about the worst programme and a tax on
// every other one.
// The price is the reference's filter on every pass, which is a fraction of the render the pass already
// is — and cheaper than any scheme that aims with one meter and verifies with the other, since that scheme
// needs an extra RENDER whenever the two disagree.
//
// ====================================================================================
// WHY THE PREDICATE IS NOT `I == target`
// ====================================================================================
// `analysis::LoudnessMeter`'s integrated measure is gated, and the ABSOLUTE gate at -70 LUFS is not
// scale-invariant (the relative one is). A block crossing it changes the SET being averaged, so `I` is
// piecewise-continuous in gain rather than smooth, and the step can be large: measured, a fixture of
// two halves at -69 and -71 LUFS reads -0.879829 LU away from `I(0) + g` the moment the quieter half
// enters. On real programme the step is bounded by one block joining a set of N: 10*log10((N+0.1)/(N+1)),
// which is -0.002 LU at 3.5 minutes and -0.096 LU at 4 seconds — and a sweep of three real mixes over
// 0..18 dB moved no blocks at all (the counts were 3168, 1437 and 3983 at every gain). The design
// answer is therefore not to assume smoothness: every candidate is MEASURED, the best FEASIBLE one is
// kept, and a target that lands inside a step is reported as `GateStep` with the two sides — never as
// `Solved`, and never as a constraint violation, because it is neither.
//
// ====================================================================================
// WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
// ====================================================================================
// The gain node it drives sits AFTER the compressor (`MasteringChain`: gate -> inputGain -> EQ ->
// mono-bass -> compressor -> clipper -> preLimiterGain -> limiter -> dither). So the compressor's gain
// reduction, and most of what the compressor does to the loudness range, DO NOT MOVE with the search.
// A compressor limit that the caller's settings already break is broken at every gain, and calling it
// "the reason the target is unreachable" would be a lie: it is reported as `UpstreamViolation`, with the
// measurement, before the search spends a pass on it. Moving that would mean solving for the compressor
// threshold, which is `dynamics::offline::ThresholdSolver`'s job and a different question.
//
// OFFLINE, AND IT ALLOCATES — said plainly because the first draft of this line said it did not, and
// it does: every pass builds and prepares an `analysis::LoudnessMeter` sized for the programme, whose
// gating-block store is a function of the programme's length and therefore cannot live in `prepare()`
// where the length is unknown. That is fine here — this class is called from a worker, never from an
// audio callback — but it is not the RT-safe promise the chain underneath makes, and a caller must not
// read one as the other. What it does NOT do is allocate per BLOCK: the tap buffers and the render
// scratch are sized once. It drives `OfflineRenderer`, which drives `MasteringChain`, so every measurement it
// makes is one the chain's fixed internal quantum has already made independent of block size —
// measured: the achieved integrated loudness of the same programme is bit-identical at renderer block
// sizes 1, 64, 256, 977, 4096 and 65536.
//==============================================================================

// Which limit stopped the search. NAMED, because a bare `unreachable` flag is a sneeze: the chain this

//
// WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE SUMMARY ABOVE, and it is not a defect in it: `GainReductionSummariser` makes EVERY
// window of the programme an entry, the silent ones included, because that is what a LIMIT must be judged on —
// a limit is a promise about the delivered programme and a caller may not buy headroom with silence. But a
// TRANSPARENCY BUDGET is a different question with the same units: "how hard does this stage work where it
// works". On the same distribution, 20 % of silence turns the music's p95 into its p93.75 — and enough silence
// zeroes the statistic outright, because the quantile then lands in the silent mass. So the two questions need
// two distributions, and the existing one may not move: the solver's own constraint reads it.
//
// THE GATE IS ON THE STAGE'S INPUT, NOT ON ITS OUTPUT AND NOT ON ITS GAIN REDUCTION. Gating on |GR| would be
// circular — it would define "where the stage works" as "where the stage worked" and report a statistic of a
// set chosen by the statistic. The input is the independent variable, and for the limiter it is already
// measured at the right place and on the right clock: `MasteringChainTaps::limiterPeakLin` is the reconstructed
// peak the limiter SAW, one per oversampled sample, at the same index as `limiterGrDb` (MasteringChain.h:141).
// Nothing new is tapped for this and nothing new is aligned.
//
// A WHOLE WINDOW IS ACCEPTED OR DROPPED, never part of one. The window is the quantile's unit, and half a
// window is an entry whose mean is over a denominator nobody stated. The window's decision is its PEAK input,
// not its mean: a limiter reacts to peaks, so a 4 ms window holding one transient over an otherwise quiet
// stretch is a window it worked in.
//
// AND EVERY FIELD IS OVER THE ACCEPTED WINDOWS — the samples' mean, max and active fraction too, not only the

    // 1509 / 1510 / 1513 active windows of 2500 across -12 / 0 / +12 dB of source at a -60 dBFS gate and read

    // 1000; -10 gives 0 / 595 / 1000; 0 gives 0 / 0 / 687.
    //
    // NB an earlier version of this note carried a second explanation — that a solve's gain normalises the
    // limiter's input, so the gate sits still by a property of the PATH. It was offered in good faith, it was
    // plausible, and it was wrong: the consumer's own renders use a fixed gain, and the counts do not move
    // when the gate is shifted under an unchanged chain. It is recorded here because it was believed long
    // enough to be written down, and because the margin alone explains every number above.

        // quietest that broke something. A search that starts past the boundary and ends there is handed `cap`
        // and never an `ok`, and what it delivers is the gentlest BROKEN render. Below the drive at which the
        // limiter engages there is no gain reduction at all, and no reduction holds any reduction limit, so
        // that drive is the missing end, and one render at it is taken here.
        //
        // THE CONDITIONS, all of them: at least one render was made, one broke a `kDriveBound` limit, none held
        // one, the engagement drive is known and lies UNDER the breaking render's — that is the test that there
        // is drive to give back, since with the limiter already idle there the chain is a plain multiply below
        // it and every drive under it breaks the limit too — and the drive can be expressed as a `(g, c)` pair
        // the actuator admits.
        //
        // THE DRIVE IS EXPRESSED BY `pairFor`, which chooses the ceiling for the drive rather than for the aim;
        // where no `(g, c)` pair expresses it the rescue is not taken.
        //
        // THE CEILING ASKED FOR IS THE AIM, and the aim less the difference already measured only where that
        // difference is larger than the aim's own margin. The certifying meter does not read the peak the
        // limiter aims at — `DriveBound::overshootAt` is that difference, measured on the renders the search
        // made, and it is a MEASUREMENT here rather than a mechanism: it is 0.02 dB on this tree's music and
        // 0.25 dB on a 15 kHz tone. `truePeakAimDb` exists to absorb it, so below that size nothing is
        // subtracted — a ceiling moved by a fraction of a margin that already covers it would move a render the
        // previous build delivered, and a target that render reached. Above it the margin is not enough and the
        // whole measured difference comes off, which puts the predicted peak back at the aim.
        // (Every PROBE subtracts it unconditionally — see the walk below: its limiter is working, so its peak
        // is pinned to its ceiling plus that difference, which is the same rule the ordinary search uses.)
        //
        // IT RUNS AFTER THE SEARCH, so a search that finds its own `ok` never reaches it and is unchanged,
        // render for render and bit for bit. Neither the idle render nor the probes after it are steps of the
        // loudness search: they move `bound` and the DELIVERED candidate and nothing else — never
        // `Best::nearest*` — so `pinnedDir` and the bracket sides below still describe the search proper.
        //
        // THEN THE BOUNDARY, with whatever the search did not spend. The idle render is `ok` and the search's
        // gentlest broken one is `cap`, which is the bracket the ordinary search would have had, so the probe
        // between them is the ordinary `DriveBound::probe` and the answer is the LOUDEST render that holds the
        // limit rather than the quietest. The refinement stops when the budget runs out, when a probe cannot be
        // expressed, or when the step falls under the actuator's resolution; with no budget left at all the
        // idle render is what comes back, which is the one case where a quiet render is delivered on purpose.
        //
        // A PROBE'S LOUDNESS NEED NOT BE MEASURABLE. The reduction is read off the tap and the peak off the
        // peak meter, neither of which needs a gating block, so a render below the absolute gate still HOLDS
        // the limit and is still the answer — the promise is about holding. What it cannot then be is `Solved`.

        // AND `binding` IS READ FROM `cap`: `bound.acted` is set here, so the verdict names what was broken at
        // the SMALLEST drive that broke anything — the boundary the refinement has just tightened — and not
        // what the render nearest the target happened to break. The rest go into `alsoViolated`.
