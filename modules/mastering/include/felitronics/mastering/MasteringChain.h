// a prefix. A partial trace looks like data.
//
// THE CLOCK IS THE INTERNAL QUANTUM, NOT THE CALL. The chain only computes anything when a quantum

// `n` — it can be 0, and it can exceed `n` by up to K-1. That is why the counts come back in the struct
// and why the capacities have to cover `n + K - 1` frames rather than `n`. A caller accumulates
// `framesWritten` across calls to know where in the stream it is.
//
// TAP TIME IS THE STAGE'S OWN TIME, and each stage's offset from the chain's INPUT is stated rather
// than hidden, because a statistic cropped to the wrong window is the defect this exists to prevent:
//
//   * `compressorGrDb[j]`  — the signed gain reduction the compressor's detector computed for CHAIN
//                            INPUT SAMPLE j, i.e. `resolved().compressorTapOffset`, which is 0. (It is
//                            applied to the lookahead-delayed copy of that sample, which is the
//                            compressor's own contract, not this one's.) It is the gain reduction of
//                            the COMPRESSED path and does not move with `compressorMix`: at mix 0 it
//                            still reads what the compressor did to a signal nobody hears. That is a
//                            statement about the detector, and a limit on it is a limit on how hard
//                            the compressor works — not on what reaches the output.
//   * `preLimiter[c][j]`   — the sample at the pre-limiter node, taken BEFORE `preLimiterGainDb` is
//                            applied, so it does NOT depend on that gain: everything upstream of the
//                            gain node is a constant of a loudness search. Its frame j is chain input
//                            sample `j - (compressorLookahead + clipperLatency)`, NOT j — the compressor
//                            delays the programme by its lookahead and the clipper by its own latency,
//                            and both are still in front of this point. A bypassed compressor still
//                            delays (its bypass is warm, through its own curve), so the offset does not
//                            depend on the bypass flags — only on which stages are PRESENT.
//   * `limiterGrDb`,
//     `limiterPeakLin`,
//     `peakClipReductionDb` — the limiter's oversampled traces, `tapOversampleFactor()` samples per frame.
//                            Their frame j is chain input sample `j - resolved().limiterTapOffset`. That
//                            offset is NOT just the stages in front: the trace is written where the gain
//                            is decided, on the oversampled copy, so it also lags by the UP leg of the
//                            limiter's own oversampler. `resolved()` computes it; do not re-derive it.
//
// A render feeds `frames` of programme and then `latencySamples()` zeros, so the tap frames that carry
// real programme are the ones whose INPUT index is below `frames` — which is the window a statistic
// must be cropped to, and the reason the offsets above are part of the contract.

// felitronics::mastering::MasteringChain — the mastering signal chain as ONE streaming, RT-safe,
// block-independent object:
//
//     gate -> inputGain -> EQ -> [M/S mono-bass] -> compressor (opt. keyed, opt. parallel) -> [soft clipper]
//          -> preLimiterGain -> true-peak limiter -> dither
//
// The EQ stage is `eq::EqEngine`'s band bank with `dynamiceq::LaneDynamics` driving each point's
// per-lane delta seam, so `eqBands[].dyn` is live here: a point with `dyn.on` and a non-zero
// `dyn.rangeDb` moves with the programme. It costs no latency and, with every point unarmed, renders
// exactly as the engine's own band loop. The producer's 16-sample control grid restarts at every CALL
// and is block-invariant here for the same reason every other stage is: the call is always the
// internal quantum, so the restart lands on the same absolute sample whatever the caller does.
//
// Nothing here is new DSP. Every stage is a module that already ships and is already tested; this is
// the composition, and the composition is where the defects live. `OfflineRenderer` is a thin wrapper
// over this — "run to the end, flush, cut the latency" — and not the other way round, so a live
// preview gets the same object a file render uses.
//
// ====================================================================================
// BLOCK INVARIANCE, and why it needs an internal quantum rather than a promise
// ====================================================================================
// The requirement is that the same input and the same parameters give the same output whatever the
// caller's block size. Five of the six stages break that on their own, and NOT in a way any tolerance
// can be written around. Everything below is measured on this tree, not argued:
//
//   * `eq::EqBand` and `stereo::MonoBass` flush their filter state once per process() CALL. State
//     below 1e-15 becomes exact zero at an instant the CALLER chose. Renders at block 4096 and block 1
//     differ in 4721 and 8908 samples respectively.
//   * That is NOT confined to a decaying tail. A band sitting at 0 dB keeps state right at the
//     threshold, so a 50000-sample tone diverges in 2083 of its samples, starting at sample 24.
//   * `dither::Dither` then AMPLIFIES it by eight orders of magnitude. Its auto-blank compares the
//     input to zero EXACTLY, and the EQ flush is what decides whether the tail is exactly zero. One
//     partition exports digital black, the other keeps emitting dither noise: 3.576e-07, three LSB of
//     a 24-bit master, for the whole tail. (With autoBlank off the quantiser absorbs the difference
//     entirely — which is what proves the auto-blank is the amplifier.)
//   * `dynamics::Compressor` is not exempt either, though its own header used to say so. With the RMS
//     window set so the follower coefficient is exactly 0.5 and a key of [1.3e-15, 1.5e-12], the power
//     state after one sample is 8.45e-31 — below the 1e-30 flush floor — while the amplitude after two
//     is 1.06e-12, ABOVE the 1e-12 floor `core::gainToDb` clamps at. One 2-sample call gives 0.478396237,
//     two 1-sample calls give 0.478396297. Half an LSB of 24-bit, out of a floor that was supposed to
//     hide it.
//   * And a whole-file call — the natural shape for an offline render — opens a LAW 8 hole:
//     `core::FlushToZero` reasons that "a block is too short to re-traverse the gap", which is false
//     for a big block. Measured on a 38000-sample tail: 37678 samples subnormal at one call for the
//     whole file, against 0 at block 64. That is the 10-100x stall Law 8 exists to prevent.
//
// So the chain does not hand the caller's block boundaries to anything. It accumulates into a fixed
// `internalBlock` and calls every stage with exactly that, always. Every per-call behaviour — the two
// filter flushes, the compressor's, the limiter's, the EQ's once-per-block coefficient recompute, and
// whatever a future stage does — is then clocked by the STREAM, not by the caller. Measured: 0
// differing samples between callers using 1, 1021 and 4096 samples, at K = 64, 128 and 512, over the
// full chain with 24-bit dither and auto-blank on. It also closes the Law 8 hole for free.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS: exactly `internalBlock` samples of latency, declared in latencySamples() like any
// other. Nothing in CPU — measured 2.26-2.30 %RT for the whole chain at every K from 16 to 4096, i.e.
// flat, so K is chosen for latency and never for speed.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER: a parameter change still lands where the caller puts it. Changes are
// deferred to the next quantum boundary, so a change made at stream position p always takes effect at
// the same place regardless of blocking — but a caller that pushes params at different stream
// positions is asking for different renders, which is not this module's to hide. Set them once before
// the render and the question does not arise. What a change does once it has landed — the glides — is
// clocked by the samples of the quanta, never by the calls, so a timeline of changes at fixed stream
// positions renders the same bits under any cut (the AUTOMATED rows of the split-invariance suite).
//
// ====================================================================================
// BYPASS, and why "just don't call it" is the wrong default
// ====================================================================================
// A stage is PRESENT (config) or absent; a present stage is ACTIVE or bypassed (params). Latency is
// the sum over PRESENT stages and never moves, which is what makes a bypass toggle safe in a host.
//
// Bypass may not be spelled with neutral-looking numbers. Measured: a limiter with its ceiling at
// +60 dBTP still costs the 0.90*Nyquist round trip (+0.000 dB at 0.40*fs, 64 taps) and its 111 samples; a
// saturator at driveDb = 0 is not linear either, because `WaveShaper` floors the drive at 1e-4.
//
// Which mechanism each stage gets is decided by measurement, not by uniformity:
//   * COMPRESSOR — its own parameters give an exactly transparent, WARM bypass: `ratio = 1` makes the
//     curve's slope exactly 0, so the gain is exactly 1.0f and the signal comes out of the lookahead
//     ring untouched, sign of zero included. Measured bit-exact against the input delayed by its own
//     latency. The detector keeps tracking, so un-bypassing does not jump. Nothing to align. (The stage
//     does own an aligner now, and it is not a bypass mechanism: it is `compressorMix`'s dry path, which
//     keeps blending through a bypass — a steady bypass is untouched by it, and an engaging one does not
//     drop.)
//   * CLIPPER and LIMITER — skipped, with a `core::DryAligner` holding their PDC. The clipper does have
//     a `mix = 0` bypass that is bit-exact for ordinary audio, but it normalises -0.0f to +0.0f
//     (`dry + 0.0f * wet`), which a bit-exact null test would report, and it pays the whole oversampled
//     wet path for nothing. The limiter has no bypass at all. A toggle is FADED (see `Fader`): entering
//     bypass fades the stage to its aligned dry over kBypassFadeMs and then stops calling it; leaving it
//     resets the stage, warms it up on the live input while the output stays on the aligned dry, and
//     fades it back in. A steady bypass is the skip it always was, bit for bit.
//   * EQ and DITHER — zero latency, so bypass is simply not calling them; the EQ is a hard step by design.
//   * MONO-BASS — zero latency, and its bypass rides the island's OWN fades (`MonoBass::setBypass`), after
//     which the island retires itself: a steady bypass returns before touching the buffer.
// A skipped stage is reset when it comes back. Without that a stage that sat out re-emits audio from
// before the gap — the defect class measured at +19.76 dB over the ceiling in the limiter (#119), 0.75
// out of digital silence in the compressor (#120), 0.93 in the saturator and +7.39 dBFS in the EQ (both

// clipper's bypass round trip read -9.2 dBFS max|Δ²y| with a ~63-sample dropout, the limiter's -12.5
// with a 111-sample hole of exact zeros.
//
// ====================================================================================
// THE CHANNEL COUNT IS EXACT
// ====================================================================================
// prepare() takes the channel count, and process() REFUSES any other, touching neither the buffer nor
// any state. It is not clamped to a prefix and the count is not allowed to vary. Two reasons, both
// concrete: the stages disagree — the compressor refuses a wider call, the limiter, saturator and EQ
// process a PREFIX and leave the rest untouched, mono-bass ignores anything that is not exactly two —
// so reconciling them from out here is precisely the field-mapping that falls out of step; and the
// C-ABI this feeds (`fc_master_create(sampleRate, channels)`) fixes the count at creation anyway.
// This turns the "stereo -> mono -> stereo" sequence into a provable property: a refused call is
// indistinguishable from one never made, so [A, refused, B] is bit-identical to [A, B].
//
// ====================================================================================
// THE GATE
// ====================================================================================
// One `isfinite`/clamp on every input sample, ahead of everything, in the shape `saturation::Saturator`
// and `limiter::TruePeakLimiter` already use. It is not decoration: `eq::Biquad` clears poison only at
// the end of a call, so one Inf reaching the EQ costs the rest of the quantum, and with every stage
// bypassed an Inf would otherwise reach the output untouched. With the gate, the chain's behaviour on
// a bad sample is ONE rule that does not depend on which stages are on: feeding a NaN is bit-identical
// to feeding the sanitised value. Bit-transparent for any finite sample within +-1e6.
//
// RT-safe: prepare() allocates, process()/flush() do not allocate, lock or throw, and accept any block
// length. `sizeof(eq::EqEngine)` is 331 KiB, so the engine is held behind a pointer and this object
// stays small enough to put on a stack.

    //             followers and its dual release's 90 ms of windows — which start fresh, as any reset starts them.
