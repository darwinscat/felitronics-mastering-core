// felitronics::mastering::OfflineRenderer — the file-render wrapper over the streaming chain: run to
// the end, drain the tail, cut the latency back off. A THIN layer, deliberately: the chain is the
// object, and a live preview drives the same one. An offline monolith with the loop inside would have
// to be taken apart the first time a plug-in wanted it.
//
// THE CONTRACT IS A FORMULA, not a description. Let `y` be what the chain emits for the input `x`
// followed by `D = chain.latencySamples()` zeros. Then
//
//     out[n] = y[n + D]   for 0 <= n < frames
//
// so the output has exactly as many frames as the input, sample n of the output is sample n of the
// input processed, and the last `D` frames — the ones that only leave the chain after the input has
// ended — are in it. That last clause is the whole reason this class exists: the ffmpeg chain this
// replaces never emitted them, measured, so a click 4 ms before the end of a file disappeared and one
// 5 ms before it survived. Restating that as arithmetic is what makes it testable rather than hoped
// for; a suite can compute the right-hand side independently and null against it.
//
// It works with frames < D (the whole output then comes out of the drain), with frames == 0, and with
// `in == out` — every block is copied into internal scratch before anything is written back, and the
// write cursor trails the read cursor by D in any case.
//
// EVERY RENDER STARTS FROM A FULL RESET, including the dither's RNG, so two renders of the same input
// with the same parameters are bit-identical. The target-loudness solver needs that: it renders,
// measures, adjusts one gain and renders again, and a second pass that started from the first pass's
// tail state would make its measurement mean something else. NB it also means a render is not a
// continuation — the chain is a streaming object and this is a whole-programme operation on it.
//
// RT: this is an OFFLINE class and does not pretend otherwise — it is called from a worker, not an
// audio callback. It does not allocate inside `render()` (the scratch is sized in `prepare()`), which
// matters because the chain underneath is RT-safe and a test that counts allocations over a whole
// render should see none.
