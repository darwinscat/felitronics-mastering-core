//==============================================================================
// felitronics::mastering::DeliveredMastering — the three whole-programme operations of a delivery, SRC FIRST:
// a render at fixed parameters, the loudness search, and the input's loudness range. Each one converts the
// programme to the delivery rate with `DeliveryConverter` and then hands it, unchanged, to the class that
// already does the job at one rate — `OfflineRenderer`, `TargetLoudnessSolver` — on a chain prepared at the
// DELIVERY rate.
//
// WHY THIS IS A CLASS AND NOT THREE LINES IN EACH CALLER. Two paths deliver a programme: the C ABI facade and
// the direct C++ call `fcore_master selftest` compares it with, bit for bit. What sits between the converter
// and the solver — which buffer the converted programme lives in, when it is allocated, that a render
// converts straight into its output and renders in place, that a range too short to measure is refused
// before a sample is converted — is exactly the kind of composition two hand-written copies get wrong in the
// same way. Written here once, both paths call it, and the bit-compare then compares an ABI against a core
// rather than a copy against a copy.
//
// WHAT IT OWNS: the converter, prepared for one (source rate, delivery rate, width, block). WHAT IT DOES NOT:
// the chain, the renderer and the solver stay the caller's, because they already have a lifecycle of their
// own (configure, channel weights, lazy preparation) and a second owner would be a second place to get it
// wrong. Every operation checks that the chain AND the solver it is handed run at the delivery rate: either one
// prepared at the source rate would render or meter a converted programme at the wrong speed, every number
// plausible.
//
// A REFUSAL WRITES NOTHING AND ALLOCATES NOTHING (law 11b). Every verdict an operation can reach is reached before
// the converter writes a sample and before a programme buffer is asked for: the renderer's width and preparation,
// overlapping planes, and — for the search — everything `TargetLoudnessSolver::admits` would refuse before its first
// pass. Converting first and letting the renderer or the solver say no afterwards left the caller's output full of
// unmastered, resampled audio, or spent a whole programme's memory on a request the solver was always going to
// refuse.
//
// MEMORY (law 11d). `render` asks the heap for NOTHING: it converts into the caller's output and renders there
// in place, which `OfflineRenderer` supports. `solve` and `measureInputLoudnessRange` cannot do that — a search
// reads its input again on every pass and may not render over it — so each holds the converted programme for
// the length of the call, and `solveBytes` / `measureRangeBytes` say how much, through the very functions the
// solver's own budgets are made of. At EQUAL RATES there is nothing to convert and the caller's input is read
// directly, so no programme buffer exists and the budget says so.
