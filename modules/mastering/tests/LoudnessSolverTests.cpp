// THE FIXTURES CARRY THEIR OWN PRECONDITIONS, because the most common defect in this project is a test
// that looks like it checks something and does not. Every group below asserts that the thing it is
// about is actually happening — the limiter is limiting, the gain is moving, the loudness range is
// wide, the constraint is reachable — before it asserts the result.
//
// AND THE ORACLES ARE INDEPENDENT WHERE THEY CAN BE. The solver measures its own render; a test that
// only re-read the solver's own numbers would pass against a solver that measured the wrong buffer. So
// the statistics are re-derived here from the DELIVERED audio with meters this file builds, and the
// gain-reduction summaries are re-derived from the chain's taps driven by hand.
