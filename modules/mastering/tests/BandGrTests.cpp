// What a dynamic EQ band did, read by the (band, lane) PAIR.
//
// THE TWO STATISTICS ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND THE TEST HAS TO SHOW THAT, not merely that both are
// finite. Over the whole programme the number says how OFTEN the band worked; over the windows in which
// its delta was not zero it says how DEEP it went when it did. On a de-esser at a realistic sibilant duty
// they are several times apart — measured on this rig, 1.795 dB against 0.315 — and a gate placed on the
// band's INPUT instead of on its delta collapses the second into the first — which is the planted control below, and the reason the gating signal is named in
// the ABI's own documentation rather than left to be inferred.

#include <felitronics_test.h>
// THE PRICE IS COUNTED FROM THE ALLOCATOR, NOT FROM `sizeof`, and through the tree's ONE counter rather
// than a hand-rolled pair of operators: moving onto that counter removed 61 of those, of which 50 could not
// see an over-aligned allocation at all, and the source gate refuses a file that grows another. Why from the
// allocator: the object `sizeof` reports is 120 bytes while its bins are a SEPARATE allocation of tens of
// thousands of entries, so an estimate built from `sizeof` came out 2500 times too small and nearly shipped
// a design costing 73 MB a solve. A number about memory that the allocator was not asked for is not a measurement.
