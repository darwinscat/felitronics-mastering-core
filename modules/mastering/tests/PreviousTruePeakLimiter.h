    // second round trip, no extra latency, no PDC field anywhere moves, and with `peakClip` off the

    // -15.55 dB at 20 kHz (oversampling::Oversampler's own figure) paid even when nothing clipped.

    // needle holds reduction for the whole release. Shaving the needle's top on the same grid the

    // at all, at 3 it only touches what is far over.

    // CHANNEL-LINKED, like everything else here: one gain for all channels on that oversampled
    // sample. Clipping each channel on its own would satisfy the same bound and move the stereo

// THE TRACE, for a caller that needs the SHAPE of what happened rather than one instantaneous number.
// `gainReductionDb()` is a display value: polling it at block ends samples the gain at the host's block
// rate, which is not a property of the signal at all — the same objection `Compressor` records for its
// own meter, one module over, and the same answer (`dynamics::GainReductionTap`).
//
// IT IS ON THE OVERSAMPLED GRID, and that is a decision rather than an implementation leak. The gain is
// decided and applied once per F×fs sample (see processChunk), so F×fs is where the trace exists;
// folding it to baseband needs a RULE, and the rule belongs to whoever reads the statistic.
//
// BE HONEST ABOUT THE SIZE OF THAT, because the first draft of this comment carried an invented number
// and the measurement is an order of magnitude smaller. Taking the MINIMUM over each group of F
// preserves the OVERALL MAXIMUM exactly — that one is a theorem, since the group maximum of the
// magnitude is kept. NOTHING ELSE IS: a fold changes the distribution, so p95 is not preserved in
// general and the second draft of this comment claiming "every upper quantile" was wrong. On the
// measured fixture the two happened to agree (p95 9.525000, max 9.538984 either way), which is one
// fixture and not a proof. What the fold biases measurably is the mean and the active fraction, and
// only upward. Swept over the whole release range on a fixture built to move the gain
// INSIDE a baseband sample (transient pairs, instant attack, 4×): the mean bias is **+0.0029 to
// +0.0080 dB** and the active-fraction bias **+0.0000 to +0.0009**, at release 0.05 ms through 50 ms.
// Small — but it is a choice, it is not zero, and it is not the caller's to discover. A caller that
// wants a baseband curve for a display folds it itself and says which rule it used.
//
// `linkedPeakLin` is THE RECONSTRUCTED PEAK THE LIMITER ACTUALLY SAW — max over channels of |x| on the
// oversampled grid, taken BEFORE the sliding window and before any gain is applied. It is the quantity
// a mastering report means by "the highest inter-sample peak inside the chain", and it cannot be
// recovered from the delivered file: the limiter's whole job is to remove it.
//
// CAPACITY IS BINDING. A non-null buffer whose capacity is short of what the call will produce REFUSES
// the whole call, leaving audio, state and the buffers untouched — the same rule as the compressor's
// tap, and for the same reason: a partial trace looks like data.

// felitronics::limiter::TruePeakLimiter — a lookahead limiter that BOUNDS EVERY SAMPLE ON ITS OWN
// F×fs GRID. It oversamples, limits at the oversampled rate (so inter-sample peaks are real samples),
// then downsamples — Option B, the only structure that can bound inter-sample peaks at all, since a
// fast-moving gain applied at baseband would itself create them.
//
// Gain law: a sliding-window MAXIMUM of the channel-linked oversampled peak over the lookahead window
// → required gain = ceiling / slidingMax (so EVERY sample in the window, including the one being output
// `lookahead` samples behind, is ≤ ceiling) → instant attack + rate-limited (release) recovery. The
// emitted sample is necessarily inside its own detector window and the release branch can only keep
// MORE reduction than required, so on that grid the bound is algebra, not a heuristic — which is the
// whole difference between this and a lookahead gain ramp.
// Under `dualRelease` the applied reduction is the larger of the two envelopes', so the same bound holds.
//
// ====================================================================================
// WHAT IT DOES NOT PROMISE — read before setting a ceiling from a platform's number.
// ====================================================================================
// The grid bound is not a bound on the reconstructed output a meter or a listener sees. Two terms open
// a gap between them, and they behave nothing alike (measured in ctest, felitronics_limiter_ceiling_tests):
//
//   * GRID GEOMETRY — closed form, and oversampling shrinks it. A crest can hide between detector
//     samples; for a tone at fs·p/q the excess is exactly −20·log10(cos(π/M')), where M' is the number
//     of distinct magnitude phases it visits on the F×fs grid. The worst tone the round trip passes FLAT
//     is 2fs/5 at 4× and 8× (+0.436 and +0.108); at 2× fs/3 still costs more (+1.250 against 2fs/5's
//     +0.436), so the allowance is a MAXIMUM over the two rather than a swap of one for the other.
//     RE-DERIVED WHEN tapsPerPhase ROSE TO 64, exactly as the sentence that used to stand here
//     demanded: at 32 taps the prototype's own droop took 0.775 dB off a 0.40 fs tone and so removed
//     2fs/5 before delivery, which left fs/3 (+1.250 / +0.302 / +0.076) worst by default. The pass band
//     is flat there now, so the tone reaches the output and the 4× and 8× figures rise by 0.135 and
//     0.032 dB. Read that correctly: the old numbers were not a property of the limiter, they were a
//     property of its lowpass, and hiding the term is not the same as not having it — the mastering chain has
//     run at 64 taps, and therefore at +0.436, since it was written. A sweep of every fs·p/q with
//     q ≤ 64 below 0.46 fs, net of the round-trip droop, confirms 2fs/5 is the maximum and that it
//     holds at every taps count anything here uses (64, 80, 96, 128, 256 all give +0.436 at 4×), but NOT
//     without limit: at 512 taps and 8× the winner becomes 4fs/9 (+0.132 net against 2fs/5's +0.108),
//     because the pass band finally reaches 0.4444 fs. Re-derive when the cutoff moves, and re-derive
//     when the taps grow far enough to deliver a smaller-M tone higher up.
//   * GAIN MODULATION — and neither oversampling nor a slower release removes it. The attack is
//     instantaneous, so the limited product is not band-limited and the downsampler overshoots
//     re-band-limiting it. It SATURATES near 0.92 dB (4×) / 0.87 (8×) above ~5 dB of reduction, and
//     does so at a 100 ms release as readily as at 1 ms. What it answers to is spectral tilt: at 4× and
//     a 50 ms release, flat noise costs 0.92 dB, roughly music-like material (one-pole, a = 0.9) costs
//     0.10 dB, and dark material 0.04 dB.
//
// Worst measured total over the witness matrix INSIDE the domain below: +1.25 / +0.99 / +0.93 dB at
// 2× / 4× / 8× (the fs/3 tone at 2×, dense material at a 1 ms release at 4× and 8×).
// NEITHER term grows with crest factor or with makeup gain (verified at +64, +76 and +88 dB) — which
// is what makes the gap characterisable, where a gain-ramp limiter misses by more the harder the
// material gets.
//
// READ THE STATUS OF THOSE NUMBERS CORRECTLY. They are a CHARACTERISATION over the witness matrix in
// felitronics_limiter_ceiling_tests at a lookahead of ≥ 1 ms and a release of ≥ 1 ms — not a theorem,
// and the floors below are NOT inside that domain. Two measured examples of leaving it: alternating
// ±500000 (i.e. +114 dBFS, inside the gate) at the release floor delivers +2.67 dB over, where the same
// shape at a 1 ms release delivers +0.44 and at 50 ms +0.004; and with BOTH parameters on their floors
// the dense witness reaches +1.87 (4×) / +1.82 (8×), past the figures above. Those two rose with the
// taps default — they were +1.59 and +1.56 at 32 taps — because at both floors the limiter is an OS-rate
// clipper and a longer, sharper FIR rings more re-band-limiting a signal of steps. Both are pinned per
// taps count in the suite. Bringing even that corner
// inside would need floors at 24 baseband samples (0.5 ms), which is a musical setting and would change
// the sound of a legitimate one — so the corner is documented instead of clamped away. The only thing
// proven for every input is the on-grid bound.
//
// UNDER `dualRelease` the same witnesses stay inside the same budgets (felitronics_limiter_ceiling_tests, "Dual release").
//
// SO: a product ceiling needs a DERATE, or a loop closed on measured true peak. Setting ceilingDbTp
// to C does not deliver C dBTP. Over the characterised domain, budget ~1.2 dB for a bright, dense,
// hard-limited master and ~0.3 dB for ordinary material, at 4× or 8× alike — and if you need a
// GUARANTEE rather than a budget, measure the delivered peak and close the loop on it.
//
// UNDER Topology::Cascade (P31; `TruePeakLimiterConfig::topology`) the same witnesses were run through
// oversampling::CascadeOversampler, and three things are different (felitronics_limiter_ceiling_tests,
// the "Cascade topology" groups):
//   * the grid term keeps its closed form, but the round trip is flat to 20 kHz, so at 44.1 kHz it now
//     DELIVERS 4fs/9 (0.4444 fs), and that becomes the worst tone at 8x (+0.133 against 2fs/5's +0.108)
//     and at 16x (+0.033). fs/3 and 2fs/5 still win at 2x and 4x, and at 48 kHz (flat to 0.4167 fs)
//     nothing moves. test_support's deliveredBudgetDbFlatTo() enumerates it from the band edge;
//   * the modulation envelope HOLDS — every dense witness and every click train at releases from 100 ms
//     down to 0.1 ms lands inside grid + 1.15 dB: worst 1.344 dB at 2x and 44.1 kHz; at 48 kHz 0.997 at 4x
//     and 0.938 at 8x, inside budgets of 1.586 and 1.258 (these two excesses are a hair above the Kaiser
//     totals quoted above, which were stated for releases >= 1 ms); and at 44.1 kHz, 4x and 8x, the cascade's
//     DENSE excess is lower than
//     Kaiser's (0.49 / 0.48 dB against 0.81 / 0.75);
//   * both floors at once: 2.03 / 1.42 / 1.37 dB at 2x / 4x / 8x and 44.1 kHz (Kaiser 2.16 / 1.87 / 1.83),
//     2.17 / 1.85 / 1.79 at 48 kHz — outside the envelope, as under Kaiser, and pinned.
// And the round trip is 131 base samples at 44.1 kHz 4x (76 at 48 kHz) plus the lookahead, where the
// table below and its droop are Kaiser's: under the cascade 20 kHz passes flat at every rate.
//
// ALWAYS IN THE PATH, even when nothing is being limited: the 0.90 × Nyquist prototype is applied TWICE,
// once interpolating and once decimating, so the top of the band is attenuated by |H|² — the dB figures
// of one pass, DOUBLED. Measured on the round trip (and derived independently from designFilter()'s
// coefficients, agreeing to three decimals) at the SHIPPED default of 64 taps, against the 32 it used
// to be:
//
//        f/fs      2× (64)   4× (64)   8× (64)  |  2× (32)   4× (32)   8× (32)

//
// THIS COMMENT USED TO READ −0.40 / −4.0 / −6.0 AND CALL THEM THE ROUND TRIP. Those are one pass. The
// correction matters because the number is a mastering decision, not a rounding error, and a product
// reading it was sizing that decision on half the truth — doubly so with a saturator in front, since a
// second oversampled stage doubles it again: at 44.1 kHz, clipper + limiter cost −1.549 dB at 17.6 kHz
// and −6.033 at 18.5 WHILE THE DEFAULT WAS 32, and +0.000 / −0.610 now. The default moved for a bigger
// reason than the droop, though — at 32 taps the prototype delivered 27 dB of stopband where its own
// Kaiser design declares 90, which is an ALIASING defect; see PolyphaseOversampler.h for the derivation.
// NB it is only APPROXIMATELY factor-independent: exact at 0.45, spread over 0.038 dB at 0.40 (32 taps).
// The suite's own budget check stops at 5fs/14 ≈ 0.357 fs, which is why the doc defect stood
// uncorrected; the frequencies the figures name are measured two-sidedly in the ceiling suite now, and
// the whole tpp × factor surface is pinned by felitronics_oversampling_tests.
//
// WHAT IS CLAMPED, all of it visible rather than silent (oversampleFactor(), lookaheadSamples(),
// effectiveReleaseMs(), effectiveCeilingDbTp()): the oversampling factor into [2, 16] (under Topology::Cascade
// a factor in that range that is not a power of two is REFUSED instead — it has no cascade); the lookahead
// into [2 baseband samples, 20 ms]; the release time constant to at least 8 baseband samples and to
// strictly less than an infinite hold; the ceiling into [-200, +60] dBTP. The two floors are measured —
// the smallest values that keep the witness matrix inside the figures above — and both sit far below any
// musical setting (42 µs and 167 µs at 48 kHz). They prevent the DEGENERACY (a lookahead of zero is an
// OS-rate clipper; a release of zero lets the gain jump every oversampled sample); they do not turn the
// characterisation below into a bound.
//
// CHANNEL COUNT is part of the topology too. Only the channels passed to process() advance their own
// history, while the detector and the gain are shared, so CHANGING the count clears the state (a
// discontinuity, which is what such a change already is) — without that, a channel that sat out a few
// blocks came back re-emitting audio at +19.76 dB over the ceiling. Passing MORE channels than
// prepared is REFUSED — `process()` returns false having touched nothing, because width is a LIMIT
// under law 11(b) and a partially limited block is worse than a refused one. This paragraph used to
// promise the opposite ("limits the first maxChannels and leaves the rest untouched"); law 11 replaced
// that behaviour and the sentence outlived it. Prepare for the most you will ever pass.
//
// RT-safe: prepare() allocates; process() does no alloc/lock/throw and accepts any block length. One
// linked gain for all channels (no image shift). Non-finite and absurd input samples are sanitised at
// the gate — bit-transparently for finite audio within ±1e6.

    // q'(T-W) = 1; q(T+W) = T+W - (2W)^2/(4W) = T and q'(T+W) = 0. On the knee q' = 1 - (a-(T-W))/(2W),
    // which lies in [0, 1], so the curve is monotone and never has gain above 1. A hard clip cannot also
    // be C1 at its corner, so kneeDb = 0 takes the plain branch and is an EXACT clamp.
    //
    // Why C1 is worth a parameter at all: a hard clip leaves a first-derivative corner and its harmonics
    // fall off like 1/n^2; this leaves a second-derivative corner and they fall off like 1/n^3. That is
    // real alias rejection while the excess is inside the knee, and nothing once the plateau dominates —
    // which is why the knee stops at 1 dB.
    //
    // THE FINAL min IS NOT DECORATION. `a - t*t*inv4W` can land one ulp above T in float, and the only
    // thing this stage actually promises — every sample on this grid is <= T — is a bit-exact claim.
