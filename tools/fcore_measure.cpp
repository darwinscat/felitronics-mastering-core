// fcore_measure — a tiny streaming measurement CLI for validating felitronics-core's analysis against a
// reference (ffmpeg), and the NATIVE SIDE of the wasm spike's parity check. Reads interleaved 32-bit-float
// little-endian PCM (as ffmpeg emits with `-f f32le`).
//
// The measurement itself lives in fcore_probe.h (and, for `clips`, fcore_clips.h), shared verbatim with the
// wasm shim — read those headers for the build contract (-ffp-contract=off here, no -mrelaxed-simd there) and
// for why the true-peak filter config is part of that contract rather than an implementation detail.
//
//   lufs        → integrated loudness (LUFS)            ↔ ffmpeg ebur128 "I:"
//   truepeak    → max true peak (dBTP, 4× oversampled)  ↔ ffmpeg ebur128 "Peak:" (True Peak)
//   correlation → whole-file normalised L/R correlation ΣLR/√(ΣLL·ΣRR) — the stereo band's own formula
//                 (analysis::StereoSums) over the whole file. Not Pearson's: nothing is centred.
//   blocks      → the CROSS-TOOLCHAIN SURFACE: every pre-gate 400 ms gating-block energy plus the true-peak
//                 linear maximum, as raw IEEE-754 bit patterns. Diffing two `blocks` outputs IS the parity
//                 test — see the note at the mode itself for why the gated scalars cannot be that test.
//   waveform    → the waveform peaks (analysis::WaveformPeaks): every bucket as a double AND as its float32
//                 form, bit patterns. A box-averaged max-abs, not above the sample peak except by rounding — NOT `truepeak`, which
//                 is fcore::Probe's reference true peak. [--buckets N] [--mix avr|L|R|max]
//   stereo      → the stereo band (analysis::StereoColumns): per column width / correlation / RMS as float32
//                 bit patterns, plus the maximum RMS as a double. RMS, not `lufs`. [--columns N]
//   needle      → correlation / width / RMS over [from, to) as double bit patterns. --from A --to B
//   clips       → the clipped runs (analysis::ClipDetector): how many were found, whether the list is whole,
//                 the sample peak of each channel, and every stored run — start, length, level, channel,
//                 polarity, evidence. Levels and peaks as bit patterns; the format lives in tools/fcore_clips_format.h
//                 and the wasm module prints it too, so a diff IS the parity test. [--max-runs N] [--chunk N]
//   stream      → the streaming surface (fcore::StreamProbe, tools/fcore_stream.h): the file fed in pieces of
//                 --chunk N frames (default 4096) and, after EACH piece, the deterministic meter's momentary,
//                 short-term and integrated LUFS as bit patterns, the samples consumed, the blocks dropped and
//                 the runs decided so far; then finish() and the runs only it decides. The wasm module prints
//                 the same bytes through its fc_stream_* handles (tools/wasm/stream-parity.mjs). [--chunk N]
//   report      → the whole-programme report (analysis::ProgrammeReport): DC, silence, tail, infra-low,
//                 stereo, PLR / LRA / short-term percentiles. Every scalar as a raw bit pattern with its
//                 validity and reason; every count as a decimal integer. Printed through the report's own
//                 field visitor, so the struct and this output cannot drift apart.
//   hum         → mains hum (analysis::HumDetector): per channel the validity reason, the mains nominal, the
//                 line's interpolated position / level / prominence, the comb, and the quiet stretches in
//                 sample coordinates — every float as a raw bit pattern, like `blocks`, so a future wasm
//                 comparison catches a flipped bit that %.17g would round away. `valid 0` is never "clean":
//                 read the reason. [--quiet-db X] [--order N]
//   lowend      → the vinyl low end (analysis::LowEnd): the integral Mid/Side energies of the LR4 low and high
//                 bands and of the unfiltered programme, every stored 10 ms block, the side-fraction histogram,
//                 the three extremum coordinates, and the full semitone band table with the dominant note —
//                 as raw IEEE-754 bit patterns, so `diff` between two toolchains IS the parity test. Every
//                 field the report publishes is here EXCEPT the law-8a trace, which exists only for the suite.
//                 An invalid note prints as `note INVALID reason N`, never as a note name. NOT `correlation`,
//                 which is a whole-file phase number with no band split.
//
//   tempo       → the page's BPM tool (tempo::TempoDetector): the headline and the whole-track view, the anchor
//                 the curve is folded toward, `varies` and the range, the five candidates and every point of the
//                 curve — doubles as raw bit patterns, a NaN (the spec's `null`) as `nan`, counts in decimal; the
//                 wasm module prints the same bytes (tools/wasm/tempo-parity.mjs). [--min-bpm X] [--max-bpm X]
//                 [--win-sec X] [--hop-sec X] [--chunk N]
//
//   forensics   → what the file WAS (analysis::SourceForensics): the spectral wall per channel and for the
// and forensics modes size the file before reading it (the first three because every boundary depends on the length,
// forensics so that a short read cannot come out as a successful measurement of a shorter programme), so they need a
//
// Usage: fcore_measure <mode> <sampleRate> <channels> <raw.f32le> [--precise] [mode options]
//
// The scalar modes print %.2f by default (tools/validate_ffmpeg.sh compares against ffmpeg's own two
// decimals); `--precise` switches them to %.17g plus the exact %a form. `blocks`, `waveform`, `stereo`,
// `needle` and `clips` are always exact, and the node side (tools/wasm/shapes-parity.mjs for the shapes,
// clips-parity.mjs for the runs) prints the same bytes.
//
// DECODE TO FLOAT, NEVER TO s16. This tool reads f32le: `ffmpeg -i x -f f32le out.f32`. The waveform, stereo, needle
// and clips modes size the file before reading it (the first three because every boundary depends on the length, clips
// because a short read must be a refusal rather than a clean report of a truncated file), so they need a seekable file,
// not a pipe. An integer decode
// (`-f s16le`, as the old sidecar generator did) clamps a lossy file's samples above 0 dBFS and quantises the
// rest, and the peaks of that are not the peaks of the file.
