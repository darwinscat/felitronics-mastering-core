#ifndef FC_MASTER_ABI_H
#define FC_MASTER_ABI_H

// fc_master — the C ABI over `felitronics::mastering`, for a browser worker (wasm32) and for the native
// reference CLI that proves the two agree. It is the DECLARATION only: the implementation is
// tools/wasm/fc_master.cpp, which compiles natively as well (EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE degrades to extern "C").
//
// ====================================================================================
// THE FACADE IS THIN, AND THAT IS A LAW RATHER THAN A STYLE
// ====================================================================================
// The desktop application links `felitronics::mastering` AS C++, past this file entirely. So this
// surface may never become the only road to a capability: everything it can do has to be reachable
// without it. What is duplicated here is exactly two things — the ENUM CODES and the FIELD MAPPING.
// No arithmetic. Not one clamp, not one default, not one derived number. Every value this header hands
// back was computed by the core and read out of it — save one, `fc_need.facadeBytes`, the facade's own
// `sizeof`, named as such and never added to a core number; where the core cannot answer, this file
// refuses rather than inventing.
//
// The mechanical proof of that is `fcore_master selftest`: the same programme rendered through this
// ABI and through a direct C++ call, in ONE binary on ONE machine, compared bit for bit. A facade that
// had grown arithmetic of its own would have to be wrong in exactly the same way twice to pass it.
//
// ====================================================================================
// SHAPE
// ====================================================================================
// * PLANAR float32, ONE pointer, channel c at `planar + c * frames`. Same choice and same reason as
//   fc_probe.cpp: a `const float* const*` across the wasm boundary would mean building a table of i32
//   offsets in the heap and exporting HEAPU32 to write it, for no gain — and AudioBuffer.getChannelData(c)
//   is already planar, so the page does one HEAPF32.set() per channel and no de-interleave loop.
// * ONE CALLBACK per handle, `fc_master_set_progress`; on wasm without one, `Module.onProgress(msg)` (false/throw = stop).
// * `uint32_t` frame counts. wasm32 is a 32-bit target and a signed frame count invites an overflow
//   that cannot happen on the 64-bit machine this core was written on.
// * EVERY entry point returns `fc_status`. Nothing returns a value in band with an error.
//
// ====================================================================================
// WHY A STATUS CODE HERE, WHEN THE CORE ANSWERS `bool`
// ====================================================================================
// Law 11 (docs/DSP-ARCHITECTURE.md §2) makes every block-level `process()` a `[[nodiscard]] bool` and
// says plainly that a second refusal idiom for the same concept is how a core ends up with four
// policies. This is not that second idiom, and the difference is the CALLER.
//
// The law's argument for a bare `bool` is that "the reason is always visible at the call site — the
// caller knows what it passed". That argument holds for C++ code that passed three arguments by hand.
// It does NOT hold here: the caller is JavaScript that marshalled a 6 KB struct of several hundred
// fields into linear memory, and "which field was refused" is not visible at its call site at all.
//
// So the codes below name THIS FILE'S OWN checks — the ones the core does not make and cannot make:
// a handle that was destroyed, a span that leaves the wasm heap, a misaligned pointer, a struct whose
// version this build does not know, an enum code that names nothing. The core's own refusal maps to
// exactly ONE code, `FC_REFUSED_BY_CORE`, and this file never guesses a reason for it, because it does
// not have one: `bool` is what the core said.
//
// `fc_master_last_error(h)` was considered and rejected: it cannot answer for a handle that is itself
// invalid, it lets a stale reason outlive the call that produced it, and every getter then has to
// decide whether it clears it.
//
// ====================================================================================
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES *NOT* CHECK, AND WHY REFUSING WOULD BE WORSE
// ====================================================================================
// IT NEVER RANGE-CHECKS A PARAMETER VALUE. The core clamps them BY DESIGN and reports what it clamped
// to — `TruePeakLimiter` folds `ceilingDbTp` into [-200, +60] and the mastering suite pins that a
// ceiling of 1e308 comes back as 60. A facade that refused "+5 dBTP" would diverge from the direct C++
// call, which renders it clamped; worse, it would need its own table of every stage's range, which is
// exactly the field mapping that falls out of step the first time a stage moves one. So a value out of
// range is the CORE's business and comes back through `fc_master_resolved`.
//
// What it does check about a value is that it is FINITE, because there the core has no verdict to
// forward: `MasteringChain` maps a NaN gain to 0 dB silently, so a page that wrote NaN into a slider
// would get a render with no gain, no refusal and no way to find out.
//
// IT NEVER REFUSES A CALL OVER A NON-FINITE AUDIO SAMPLE either — see fc_master_process.

//==============================================================================
// VERSIONING
//
// Every struct that crosses this boundary begins with the same two fields, and they are the first two
// things read: `abiVersion` says which contract the caller was compiled against, `structSize` says how
// big it believed the struct to be. A build that does not know the version refuses; a size that does
// not match the version's size refuses. Neither is a warning — a struct read at the wrong layout is a
// silently plausible parameter set, which is precisely the failure this pair exists to prevent.
//
// EXACT size match, not ">=", for v1 — and v1 said the first version to add a field would state its own
// rule. v2 is that version (`fc_master_config::deliveryRate` and the delivering entry points), so the rule
// follows, and it is written so that the NEXT bump is a row in a table rather than an event. v3 is the first
// bump made by it — `compressorMix`, two rows in the size table and a field at the end of two structs. v4 is
// the gain-reduction trace: one entry point, `fc_solution_gr_trace`, which rule 1 says moves the version on
// its own, the header-less bucket it copies, and the trace's bucket counts and validity at the end of `fc_measurement`
// — one row. v6: the limiter's dual release (`fc_master_params`, `fc_master_resolved`), `grTraceBuckets`
// (`fc_loudness_request`), `fc_solution_gr_trace64` and `fc_master_need_solve` — three rows, two entry points.
// v7: `fc_master_eq_curve` — one entry point, no struct, and therefore no row.
// v8: the gain-reduction PERCENTILE — the `q` each limit binds at the end of `fc_loudness_request` (one row) and
// `fc_solution_gr_quantile`, the general read-back that replaces a fixed field per fraction.
// v9: `fc_master_eq_dyn_times` — one entry point, no struct, and therefore no row, exactly as v7.
// v10: the limiter's ACTIVE-WINDOW gain-reduction statistics — `fc_gr_active_stats` and
// `fc_solution_gr_active_stats`, plus the gate itself at the end of `fc_loudness_request`: a new struct with
// its own id, one entry point and one row. NOTHING existing moved: `fc_gr_stats` is nested by value and
// therefore frozen (rule 3), and the solver's own constraint still reads the ungated distribution.
//
// A NEW CODE IS NOT A NEW VERSION, and the rule for codes is written here rather than left to be inferred
// from the one for structs. A status or op code is only ever APPENDED — an existing code never changes
// meaning or value — so a caller built against an older header meets a code it does not know exactly
// where it already has to handle "not FC_OK", and nothing it relied on moved. (FC_ERR_POISONED and the
// FC_NEED_* ops came in this way.)
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE COMPATIBILITY RULE (v2 onward)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// 1. WHAT MOVES THE VERSION. One number for the whole ABI, and it moves when the surface a caller may use
//    grows: a struct with a header gains a field, OR an entry point is added. The second half is not
//    pedantry — a page's only protection against calling an export the module does not have (a TypeError,
//    not a status) is the loader's "module version >= page version" gate, so an entry point that arrived
//    without a bump would pass that gate and still be missing.
//
// 2. WHAT A BUMP MAY DO. One logical addition, which may append fields to the END of any number of structs
//    that begin with `fc_header` (v3, `compressorMix`, is one bump that appends to `fc_master_params` and
//    to `fc_master_resolved`). An IN field carries a default under which the call behaves exactly as the
//    previous version did, bit for bit — `deliveryRate = 0` is v1. An OUT field is written with what the
//    core computed.
//
// 3. WHAT NEVER GROWS. `fc_header`; every struct nested BY VALUE (`fc_eq_band`, `fc_compressor`, `fc_gr_limit`
//    …) — a field inside `fc_compressor` would move everything after it in `fc_master_params`; and every element
//    of a header-less array (`fc_solve_pass`, written with a stride of its `sizeof`). A new stage therefore
//    arrives as fields at the end of a top-level struct, or as a NEW nested struct appended whole at the end —
//    frozen from the version that introduced it.
//
// 4. NO IMPLICIT TAIL PADDING in a struct with a header: a struct whose last field ends short of its `sizeof`
//    names the gap (`_pad0`), and the facade pins `sizeof == end of the last field`. Two reasons, neither of
//    them about JavaScript (fc-master-layout.mjs aligns fields itself): a grown struct must be strictly BIGGER
//    than its previous version, or a caller that bumped the layout and forgot the version is read at the old
//    layout with no refusal; and an old caller's padding bytes are uninitialised memory that the facade copies
//    over its defaults — a new field placed in them would be read from garbage.
//
// 5. THE SIZE OF EVERY (struct, version) IS ONE ROW OF `FC_MASTER_STRUCT_SIZES` below, and nowhere else. A
//    struct that did not change in a version inherits its previous row; a struct introduced in version N has no
//    size before N. `fc_master_sizeof(id, version)` publishes the table, 0 for a pair it does not have.
//
// 6. READING AN IN STRUCT. The first 8 bytes are bounded; the version must be 1..FC_MASTER_ABI_VERSION, else
//    FC_ERR_ABI_VERSION; `structSize` must be that version's row, else FC_ERR_STRUCT_SIZE; then exactly
//    `structSize` bytes are bounded and copied OVER THE CURRENT LAYOUT FILLED WITH ITS DEFAULTS — the same writer
//    `fc_*_defaults` uses. Every later bound and alias check on that struct uses `structSize`, not this build's
//    `sizeof`. A version NEWER than the build is refused, and that is a decision, not a gap: the build cannot
//    know what the extra bytes mean, and reading a caller's intent as "whatever fits" is the silently plausible
//    parameter set this pair of fields exists to prevent.
//
// 7. WRITING AN OUT STRUCT. Same checks. The caller's header is left as it is (an echo), and exactly its
//    `structSize` bytes are written — a field past them is not written at all. Stamping this build's own
//    version and size into a buffer laid out for an older one would advertise room the caller never allocated,
//    and the next call through that buffer would write past it.
//
// 8. DEFAULTS. `void fc_*_default(out)` cannot know how big `out` is, so they are FROZEN at v1 — they stamp v1
//    and write exactly v1's bytes, for callers compiled against v1. Everything newer uses `fc_*_defaults(out)`,
//    which requires the caller's stamp (FC_INIT, or `Struct.init()` in JS) and writes that version's size.
//    ⚠ A caller that fills a struct from a FROZEN writer and then sets a newer field has written it past the
//    stamped size, where it is not read: `deliveryRate` set that way is ignored and the handle does not convert,
//    and `compressorMix` set that way renders at mix 1. That is what rule 6 must do with a v1 struct, and it is
//    why the JS accessor refuses a field past the stamp.
//
// WHAT ONE BUMP TOUCHES — each a line, and the list is the whole of it:
//   * this file: the field(s), a row per grown struct in FC_MASTER_STRUCT_SIZES, FC_MASTER_ABI_VERSION, and
//     the entry-point declarations if any;
//   * tools/wasm/fc_master.cpp: the layout pins (sizeof / offsetof / arity), `toCore`/`fromCore`, the defaults
//     writer, and the entry points — and, for a NEW struct with a header, its `AbiId` specialisation;
//   * tools/wasm/fc-master-layout.mjs: the fields in STRUCTS and FC_MASTER_ABI_VERSION — and the copy of that
//     file the site ships (see TRANSITION below);
//   * tools/fcore_master.cpp: the hand mirror in `directRender`, the key=value parser, the offset table behind
//     `fcore_master layout`, and the selftest fixture (every new field moved off its default);
//   * tools/tests/MasterAbiTests.cpp: the version matrix.
//
// TRANSITION. The rule makes v3 cheap for a page written against v2; it cannot reach back into a page already
// shipped against v1, whose loader requires `version === 1` and fails on a v2 module before its first call.
// The move from v1 to v2 on the site is therefore a coordinated release of the worker and the module together.

// STATUS
//
// Order is not accidental: it is the order the checks run in, which law 11 makes part of the contract
// so that one malformed call has one answer.
//
//   POISON -> handle -> the handle's STATE -> out-parameters (null, alignment, in-heap) -> struct
//   headers (the first 8 bytes bounded, then version, then size, THEN the rest of the struct's span) ->
//   NARROWING (a count this ABI cannot hand the core's `int`) -> audio spans and their aliases -> field
//   values -> core
//
// Three details of that are load-bearing rather than incidental. THE HANDLE'S STATE comes second
// because a call that is illegal for this handle is illegal whatever else it carries. OUT-PARAMETERS
// come before the input structs because a call that cannot report its result must not perform it. And
// NARROWING comes before the spans because it is the only check that can still fire: a frame count past
// INT_MAX makes a byte span past 32 bits too, so a span check placed first would answer every such call
// with FC_ERR_SPAN and the specific diagnosis would be unreachable.
//
// POISON COMES FIRST, AND IT IS FOR EVER (law 11d, docs/DSP-ARCHITECTURE.md). Under -fno-exceptions an exhausted
// heap does not come back as a status: the module ABORTS inside the core, and the page receives a JavaScript
// RuntimeError instead of a return value. What the abort does NOT do is stop the module — emscripten lets the
// page call again, with every object wherever the abort left it — and such an instance does not fail, it LIES.
// Measured on v0.30.0 in wasm32: an abort inside `fc_master_solve`, then `fc_master_process` on the same handle
// answered FC_OK and rendered at the search's own pass-1 gain — +12 dB in that replay, which asked for that
// start (`initialGainDb`; MasterAbiTests repeats the scenario) — and kMaxHandles − 1 = 7 such aborts left the
// handle table full for good, because each reserves its solution slot before the search runs. So every entry
// point that returns `fc_status` marks a call in progress and clears the mark only on a normal return. Finding
// it set means an earlier call never returned — an abort, a trap, or natively an exception that escaped — and
// from then on every such call answers FC_ERR_POISONED, writes nothing and touches nothing. There is no way back
// inside the instance: the page discards it and instantiates a new one. The entry points that return no status —
// the frozen v1 `*_default` writers, `fc_master_sizeof` and the build-identity queries — read no instance state
// and stay callable. The versioned `*_defaults` writers return a status and are therefore guarded like every other
// such entry point: a poisoned module refuses them too.
//
// THE MODULE IS NOT RE-ENTRANT, and the poison is what says so. An entry point called while another is still
// running — from a new_handler, a signal handler, anything the runtime runs inside an allocation this file made —
// cannot be told apart from the first call after an abandoned one, and is answered FC_ERR_POISONED, for good. (The
// code-review round: a native new_handler that destroyed a spare handle during `fc_master_create` used to work and
// now poisons the module. A browser page cannot install one; a native host must not.)

    //     of the chain's three dry aligners hands back when its preparation re-sizes it — 12 bytes for

// HANDLES
//
// A handle is an INDEX AND A GENERATION packed into 32 bits, not a pointer. A raw pointer cast to
// uint32_t would make `destroy` followed by any further call a use-after-free that wasm does not trap:
// there is no unmapped page in a linear memory, so the read succeeds and returns whatever the allocator
// has since put there. With a generation, a stale handle is a refusal (FC_ERR_HANDLE) instead.
// Zero is never a valid handle.
//
// THE GENERATION IS 24 BITS WIDE, and the width is the design rather than spare space. A narrow
// generation forces a choice between ABA (reuse the numbers) and RETIREMENT (spend the slot), and
// retirement turns a table of eight live objects into a LIFETIME BUDGET — at 8 bits, 2040 create/destroy
// cycles per page load, after which every correct create is refused for ever. That is reachable: the
// reference CLI creates a handle per programme, so a worker written from it would die on its 2041st
// file. At 24 bits the budget stops being a question and a fabricated handle still differs from the
// live one in one of 24 bits.

//
// THE HANDLE IS WRITTEN ONLY ON FC_OK, and `out` is not touched at all otherwise — not even cleared.
// Clearing on entry reads as the careful thing and is not: a caller reusing a variable that still held
// a LIVE handle would have it wiped by a call that failed on the version field, and the object it named
// would be unreachable and undestroyable. A COUNT out-parameter (`written`) is the opposite and IS
// cleared, because zero is the truthful answer for a call that wrote nothing — but not FIRST: only once
// the checks on the call's arguments are behind it, since until the alias check has run it may point into
// the very buffer the call is about to refuse. A call those checks refuse leaves it as it was.
fc_status fc_master_create (const fc_master_config* cfg, fc_master* out);

// Apply a parameter set and report back what the chain will actually run.
//
// WHY THIS RE-PREPARES, AND WHY IT IS REFUSED MID-STREAM. `MasteringChain::setParams()` defers to the
// next internal quantum — deliberately, so a parameter change lands at the same place in the stream
// however the caller cut it — and `resolved()` reads the stage state, i.e. the last APPLIED set. So a
// configure that wrote the parameters and read `resolved()` straight back would hand the caller the
// PREVIOUS set: measured on the full chain at 48 kHz, a **5.0000 dB** error on the limiter ceiling and
// **149.968 ms** on its release (a first set at -1 dBTP / 50 ms read back after a second at -6 / 200),
// with the mono-bass corner reading 120 Hz where 250 had been asked for — and on a freshly prepared
// chain it reports the core's own defaults rather than anything the caller asked for. The suite's own
// fixture uses a different pair of sets, so the numbers here are the measurement's, not that test's.
//
// Applying early instead is WORSE, and that was measured too: `dither::Dither::setParams()` reseeds its
// RNG whenever the seed changes, and `eq::EqBand::setParams()` SNAPS while uninitialised and glides
// after, so N configure calls with no audio between them do not equal one call with the last set —
// which would make a render depend on how many times a knob was moved before the button was pressed,
// and `OfflineRenderer` promises exactly the opposite.
//
// What is left is the order the core itself blesses: "configure, then prepare" — MasteringChain.h says
// in as many words that this is the order a C-ABI facade takes, and `prepare()` applies the pending set
// and then resets. So this call stores the parameters and re-prepares, which makes `resolved` exact and
// makes N calls identical to the last one alone. It COSTS NOTHING at the heap — it used to rebuild the
// 331 KiB EQ engine and pay 345 224 bytes to change nothing, and the chain now re-uses it and assigns every
// buffer to the length it already has (`FC_NEED_CONFIGURE` publishes the 0, and a suite pins it). It is
// still NOT real-time — it is a worker call between renders, and it says so.
//
// It is therefore REFUSED with FC_ERR_STATE once audio has been handed to this handle, because
// re-preparing would silently discard the stream. `fc_master_reset` is how a caller gets back to the
// head of one.

// `fc_master_solve`: the output of a conversion is a different number of frames than its input, and one
// planar stride cannot describe both. A delivering handle renders through `fc_master_render_delivered`.
//
// REFUSED WITH FC_ERR_STATE ON A HANDLE THAT HAS SOLVED, until `fc_master_configure` runs. A search
// resets the chain on every pass and leaves its OWN gain and ceiling in it, standing wherever its last
// pass ended — so a process call here renders a parameter set the caller never chose. Measured: the
// output differs from the delivered render in 558 691 of 576 000 samples and from the CONFIGURED render
// in 575 998. `fc_master_reset` does NOT lift the refusal, because it clears audio state and keeps the
// solver's parameters; only a configure puts a known set back.
//
// BLOCK INVARIANCE SURVIVES THIS BOUNDARY because nothing here re-blocks anything: the call is handed
// to `MasteringChain::process()` in one piece and the chain accumulates into its own fixed quantum,
// which is the only reason "same input, same output, whatever the caller's block size" is a theorem
// rather than a hope. The FIFO lives in the chain and persists across ABI calls, so cutting a programme
// into 1-sample calls and into one whole-file call give the same bits.
//
// A NON-FINITE INPUT SAMPLE IS NOT A REFUSAL HERE, and that is a decision with a reason. The chain
// already gates every input sample (isfinite/clamp, ahead of every stage), so its behaviour on a bad
// sample is ONE rule that does not depend on which stages are on. Refusing the call instead would
// throw away every GOOD sample travelling with the bad one — and the damage would scale with the
// caller's block size, which is the one thing this whole design exists to make irrelevant. The count

// through the chain and advances it — so a caller looping "until it returns zero" would never finish and

// v9 — WHAT THE DYNAMICS OF ONE EQ POINT ARE ACTUALLY TIMED AT, in milliseconds.
//
// `fc_eq_dyn::atk` and `::rel` are NOT times. They are DEVIATION knobs in [0, 1] around an automatic value the
// core derives from the band's own fc/Q — 0.5 is that automatic value, 0 is four times faster and 1 four times
// slower — and the automatic value is not a field of any struct here. So the pair is unreadable from outside,
// and a caller cannot tell "50 ms" from "the slow rail" by looking at what it wrote. This call answers what the
// follower is set to.
//
// NO HANDLE AND NO RENDER, as `fc_master_eq_curve`: the parameters travel with the call, so the answer is
// available while a knob is moving. It asks the heap for nothing.
//
// PER LANE, NOT PER BAND — the contract's one surprise, and it is the core's shape rather than this facade's.
// The times come from the SIDECHAIN PROBE, and the probe sits on the LANE: a point's up-to-FC_MAX_EQ_LANES lanes
// carry their own freq/Q and therefore their own pair, while `dyn` is shared by all of them. `band` is
// 0..FC_MAX_EQ_BANDS-1 and `lane` 0..FC_MAX_EQ_LANES-1; anything else is FC_ERR_RANGE. A lane that is off, and a
// band that is off or bypassed, are answered like any other: the core computes a lane's ballistics whatever its
// switch says, so a refusal here would be this facade inventing a rule the audio does not have.
//
// THE CORE'S RAILS ARE VISIBLE IN THE ANSWER, which is the point of a readback. The lane's freq is read within
// [10 Hz, 0.49*sampleRate] and its Q within [0.05, 40] before the ballistics see them, and each knob within
// [0, 1] — so a caller that wrote MILLISECONDS into a knob reads back the slow rail, not what it meant. The call
// runs `dynamiceq::LaneDynamics::ballisticsFor`, the one expression the chain runs; it does not re-derive it, and
// the rails are that class's, read through it.
//
// `sampleRate` IN HERTZ, and it is REFUSED where a chain would refuse it rather than substituted: non-finite is
// FC_ERR_NON_FINITE and anything below `core::kMinSampleRate` (8000) is FC_ERR_REFUSED_BY_CORE. The audio path
// substitutes 48000 for a rate it cannot use, because by then `prepare` has already refused one; nothing has
// refused anything here, and an answer computed at a rate the caller did not ask about is a plausible lie.
//
// `params` IS READ BY THE MAPPING EVERY OTHER CALL USES, so this call is refused exactly where
// `fc_master_configure` is — a non-finite field FC_ERR_NON_FINITE, a filter type that names nothing
// FC_ERR_ENUM — including a non-finite `dyn.atk`/`dyn.rel`, which therefore never reaches the [0, 1] rail
// through this entry point. NEITHER OUTPUT MAY TOUCH the other or `params`: all three pairs are FC_ERR_SPAN.
//

// `band`, `lane`, `sampleRate`, then the parameter set. BOTH outputs are written on FC_OK and NEITHER is touched
// by a refusal — a caller that keeps the previous pair in them reads its own number back, not half of a new one.

// THE DELIVERING HANDLE (v2) — `fc_master_config::deliveryRate != 0`. SRC FIRST: the programme is converted to
// the delivery rate as one whole-programme operation (`mastering::DeliveryConverter`), and everything that
// measures or limits then sees the rate that is delivered, with the dither still the last thing to touch it.
// The composition lives in the core (`mastering::DeliveredMastering`), not here: this file forwards to it, and
// `fcore_master selftest` compares the two bit for bit.
//
// Each of these answers FC_ERR_STATE on a handle that does not deliver (`deliveryRate == 0`).
//
// THE CHECK ORDER FOR THE TWO LENGTHS is the header's own (narrowing before spans), made explicit because there
// are two: `inFrames`, `outFrames`, or the delivered length the core computes, past INT_MAX -> FC_ERR_RANGE;
// only then `outFrames` != the delivered length -> FC_ERR_CAPACITY; then the spans. `in` has stride `inFrames`,
// `out` has stride `outFrames`, and the two spans may not touch at all.
//
// A NON-FINITE INPUT SAMPLE is gated ahead of the conversion by the chain's own rule (NaN/inf -> 0, clamp +-1e6) and
// counted (`fc_master_stats::nonFiniteIn`): converting a NaN is bit-identical to converting a zero in its place, as
// processing one is on a plain handle. Without that a windowed sinc would spread one bad sample over its kernel.

//==============================================================================
// WHERE THE OUTPUT SITS AGAINST THE INPUT — the question a caller has to answer before it can compare the
// two, and it has two halves that are easy to confuse for one.
//
// THE LATENCY IS ALREADY OFF. `OfflineRenderer`'s contract is arithmetic, not a description: with `y` the chain's
// output for the input followed by `D = latencySamples` zeros, `out[n] = y[n + D]`. So the output has exactly as
// many frames as the input, output sample n IS input sample n processed, and the chain's tail — the last `D`
// frames, which leave the chain only after the input has ended — is IN it rather than cut off. There is no
// residual offset to correct and no field reporting one, because there is nothing to report: a caller that
// subtracts `latencySamples` here is introducing an error, not removing one. Pinned in MasterAbiTests three ways
// — bit for bit with every stage bypassed, by correlation lag with the stages running, and by where a lone
// impulse lands — and in MasteringChainTests against the formula's own right-hand side.
//
// THE RATE IS THE OTHER HALF, AND IT IS NOT LATENCY. On a delivering handle the input is at `sampleRate` and the
// output at `deliveryRate`, `fc_master_delivered_frames` long. The two therefore have different lengths and
// different sample grids, so output index n is NOT input index n whenever the rates differ, while 0.25 s in is
// still 0.25 s out. A consumer comparing the two — a crest or a band level per 400 ms window, say — states its
// windows in TIME and converts each side at its own rate; an index-for-index comparison silently measures a
// drift that is the resampling ratio, not the processing.

// The exact delivered length for `inFrames` of programme — `DeliveryConverter::deliveredFrames`, read out, never
// recomputed: the natural `ceil(inFrames * deliveryRate / sampleRate)` in double is wrong on real lengths (147
// frames at 44.1 -> 48 kHz is 160, and the double says 161). `*outFrames` is written only on FC_OK.

// v13 — WHAT A DYNAMIC EQ BAND DID, read by the (band, lane) PAIR.
//
// PER LANE, NOT PER BAND, and it is the core's shape rather than this facade's — the same surprise
// `fc_master_eq_dyn_times` carries. The `dyn` block is shared by a point's lanes, but each lane has its
// own probe, its own level and therefore its own delta: a band with Mid and Side both enabled has two
// different answers at once, and "the band's GR" is not one number. `band` is 0..FC_MAX_EQ_BANDS-1 and
// `lane` 0..FC_MAX_EQ_LANES-1; anything else is FC_ERR_RANGE.
//
// THE UNIT IS NOT THE COMPRESSOR'S. This is the DEPTH OF THE DYNAMIC DELTA AT THE BELL'S CENTRE, in dB,
// as it stood at each internal quantum — not a change in loudness, and not one multiplier over the whole
// signal the way a compressor's gain reduction is. The statistics carry |delta|; its SIGN is the sign of
// `dyn.rangeDb`, which the caller already has: negative cuts as the band gets loud, positive lifts, and
// the delta saturates at exactly `rangeDb` (measured: a request of 99 dB reaches 30.0000 and no further,
// because the core clamps the magnitude to 30).
//
// TWO HALVES, AND NEITHER IS THE OTHER:
//   * `fc_solution_band_gr_stats` — over the WHOLE programme. `activeFraction` is the share of quanta
//     with a non-zero delta: "how OFTEN it worked".
//   * `fc_solution_band_gr_active_stats` — over the windows in which the delta was not zero: "how DEEP
//     when it did". Its `thresholdDb` echoes -inf, which this ABI's own gate documentation defines as
//     "every window that carried any non-zero input at all" — and the gating signal here is the DELTA
//     itself, so -inf reads as "any window in which this band did something". There is no dB threshold
//     to set, and 0.0 is not written there because 0.0 would read as a gate at 0 dBFS.
// The pair is not circular ONLY because both are published: the active number is conditioned, and the
// whole-programme `activeFraction` states the condition. A page deciding "is a de-esser needed" from the
// active p95 alone will always see a busy band. Measured, on a de-esser at 0.5 % sibilant duty: the delta
// is non-zero on 9.6 % of quanta, the active p95 reads 5.41 dB and the whole-programme p95 reads 0.27.
//
// `aboveRange` IS STRUCTURALLY ZERO HERE, and that is not "nothing exceeded the range". The distribution
// spans 0..30 dB because the core clamps |delta| to exactly that, so there is nothing above it to count.
// The field is kept because `fc_gr_stats` is one shape shared with the compressor and the limiter.
//
// ONLY ARMED PAIRS HAVE AN ANSWER, and "armed" is exactly the three refusals turned inside out: `dyn.on`,
// `rangeDb != 0`, the lane enabled. A pair that was not armed while the render ran has no statistic —
// FC_ERR_BAND_NOT_DYNAMIC, FC_ERR_BAND_INERT or FC_ERR_LANE_OFF says which. That is a different rule from
