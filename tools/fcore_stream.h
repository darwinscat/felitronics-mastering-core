// fcore::StreamProbe — loudness and clipped runs of a stream that arrives piece by piece, read BETWEEN the
// pieces. The body shared verbatim by the `fc_stream_*` handles of the wasm shim (tools/wasm/fc_probe.cpp)
// and by `fcore_measure stream`, as fcore::ClipProbe is shared by the two `clips` roads. Nothing is measured
// here: analysis::DeterministicLoudnessMeter and analysis::ClipDetector do the measuring and are not touched.
//
// WHY THE DETERMINISTIC METER AND NOT LoudnessMeter. The system-libm meter does not give the same block
// energies natively and in wasm at every rate — `fcore_measure blocks` against parity.mjs on a 4 s
// make-fixture.mjs programme: equal at 22050 / 44100 / 48000 / 96000, different in 30 / 32 / 30 of 37 blocks at
// 8000 / 88200 / 192000. DetMath does not differ, and it is what ProgrammeReport has measured with since the libm audit.
// fc_probe_run still sits on the system meter, so its numbers are NOT a reference for these.
//
// WHY NOT fcore::ClipProbe. Its whole contract is a FILE: it wants the length at prepare() and answers
// nothing until finish(). A stream has no length, and the point of this class is to be read before the end.
// So the detector is driven directly, and what ClipProbe's traps taught is kept where it still applies:
//   · A REFUSAL THAT CARRIED SAMPLES POISONS. Samples the caller handed over were not consumed, so every later
//     reading would describe less audio than the caller believes. Once poisoned, valid() is false for good.
//     A zero-length call carries nothing and destroys nothing.
//   · finish() IS IDEMPOTENT, and after it a call that carries samples is refused — and poisons, because the
//     frozen report no longer covers the stream as the caller sees it.
//   · RUNS READ BEFORE finish() ARE THE RUNS DECIDED SO FAR, not the runs of the audio so far: a run is decided
//     decisionDelaySamples() (20 ms) after it ends, and the last ones exist only after finish(). The run list
//     is append-only — a run, once readable, keeps its index and its fields — which is what lets a reader
//     poll it by index.
//
// THE BUILD CONTRACT of fcore_probe.h applies: ClipDetector's smooth-crest bound decides WHETHER a run exists,
// and a fused multiply-add moves it. Both roads build -ffp-contract=off; anything compared with them must too.
