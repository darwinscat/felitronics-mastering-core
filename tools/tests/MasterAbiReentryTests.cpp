// fc_master — RE-ENTRY POISONS THE MODULE, AND FOR GOOD (law 11d). A binary of its own because the poison is permanent by
// contract: felitronics_master_abi_tests spends its one poisoning on a call that never returned, and a second scenario
// cannot share a process with it. This one needs no exceptions, so the wasm tier runs it too.
//
// The scenario is the one fc_master_abi.h names under "THE MODULE IS NOT RE-ENTRANT": an entry point called while
// another is still running — here from inside an allocation the module made, a native new_handler's position. The inner
// call cannot be told apart from the first call after an abandoned one, so it answers POISONED; the outer call returns
// normally; and from then on every status call answers POISONED, although every call returned. "For good" is the latch
// in FC_GUARD: without it the module would answer again once the outer call returned, and the 14 the inner call handed
// out would have been a lie.
