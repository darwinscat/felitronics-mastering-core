// layer runs under ctest, ASan and UBSan like anything else.

// WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR, said plainly because it decides what belongs in it: every REFUSAL the ABI

//
// What is NOT here: the bit-exactness of the render, which needs a whole programme and lives in
// `fcore_master selftest`; and the detached-view discipline, which needs a wasm heap and lives in the
