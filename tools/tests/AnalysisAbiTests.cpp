// The offline analyzers' ABI surface under adversarial arguments — natively, so it runs under ASan/UBSan on every row.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The parity harnesses exercise these getters only with capacities the module itself
// handed out, which is exactly the case that cannot fail. Everything a real caller can do wrong — a null
// pointer, a capacity of zero, a capacity one short of a row, a buffer that is not a multiple of the
// stride, a getter read before any run or after a refused one — was checked by hand once and would not
// have been checked again. A safety contract with no test is a comment.
//
// Every buffer here is surrounded by canaries and every call is followed by a check that they are intact:
// a getter that writes one element past its capacity is the defect this suite exists to catch, and it is
// invisible to a diff of two successful runs.

// The allocation oracle, the repo's usual global-operator-new idiom, counting BYTES as well as calls: the

// what prepare() actually asks the heap for.
//
// IT COUNTS WHAT THE CONTAINER ASKED FOR, WHICH IS THE QUANTITY A BUDGET STATES — and on MSVC's STL that is
// not what operator new is handed. On x86/x64 it asks for sizeof(void*) + 31 more on a block of 4096 bytes
// or upwards (its hand alignment, <xmemory>), so the correction below takes that back off. It is the same
// correction, for the same reason, as ReferenceTruePeakMeterTests.cpp and LoudnessConformanceTests.cpp:
// spelled here rather than shared because `operator new` has to be defined once per PROGRAM and each of
// these suites is its own. MEASURED, not assumed: this suite was green on macOS and on x86-64 Linux and failed
// eleven checks under MSVC — the calibration below caught it first and by itself, reporting a 4096-double
// The allocation counter is `test_support/alloc_counter.h` — ONE definition per executable, and it
// installs EVERY replaceable form, the over-aligned ones included. The private copy that used to live here
// replaced only the two default-aligned forms, so an over-aligned request (core::AlignedVector, and every
// analyzer scratch that rides one) was invisible to the very oracle this file exists to be. The MSVC
// container-padding correction it carried is in the shared header too, as `alloc::containerBytes`.

// The independent side of the price oracle: the core's own storageFor(), called here with the arguments the
// shim is supposed to pass. Not an independent implementation of the formula — a second copy of THAT is
// exactly what law 11d exists to prevent — but independent of the SHIM, which is where this suite's mutants
// live.

//   * a refused parameterised run leaves NOTHING half-swapped. The established contract here is that a
//     refusal goes silent, and the state to rule out is new parameters sitting beside old events, which
//     is the one combination a reader cannot detect from the outside.
