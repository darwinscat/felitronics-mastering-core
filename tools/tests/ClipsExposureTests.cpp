// The EXPOSURE of analysis::ClipDetector — fcore::ClipProbe, the `clips` text format and the wasm C ABI.
// The detector itself is tested by felitronics_clip_detector_tests and is not touched here; what is under
// test is the wiring that exposes it, which is where an instrument learns to lie.
//
// FOUR THINGS IT PROVES, IN ORDER OF WHAT WOULD HURT MOST IF IT WERE FALSE:
//
//  1. NO ROAD CAN CERTIFY A FILE IT DID NOT MEASURE. A report read before finish() is short by up to
//     decisionDelaySamples() of runs; a refused process() still lets the detector finish; and a refused
//     prepare() leaves the PREVIOUS file's answer behind isFinished() == true (measured on this tree: a good
//     run, finish(), then prepare(0.0, …) → isFinished() true, runCount() 1, samplePeak(0) 0.625). Each of
//     those three produces the same wrong output — `runs 0 / stored 0 / complete 1`, which reads as a
//     certificate of cleanliness. Every one of them is asserted refused, and the negative control is spelled
//     out: the mutation stand below removes each guard and the suite must go red.
//
//  2. LAW 8a ON THE SHIPPED ADAPTER, NOT ON THE DETECTOR. fcore::ClipProbe is the class both roads drive, and
//     it is the one that walks the planes and cuts the stream. So the slicing matrix runs THROUGH IT, and the
//     bug class it exists to exclude — `planar[c]` instead of `planar[c] + off` in the chunk loop — is one a
//     test that hands the detector correct plane pointers cannot see. The detector's own re-slicing is
//     already covered in modules/analysis; re-proving it here would prove nothing about this diff.
//
//  3. AN INVARIANCE TEST COMPARES CODE WITH ITSELF, SO AN ORACLE SITS BESIDE IT. Fourteen slicings agreeing
//     bit for bit is consistency, not truth: a deterministically wrong adapter agrees with itself everywhere.
//     Two independent witnesses are therefore pinned. (a) A bare analysis::ClipDetector, driven in one call
//     and read field by field in this file, never through readClips() — the wrapper must equal it. (b) A
//     LITERAL BIT PATTERN for a level: eleven samples at 40/64 and one at 39/64 give the mean 479/768, whose
//     double is 3fe3f55555555555, cross-checked here against the exact rational. That constant is what
//     catches the one mutant no invariance comparison can: rounding every level through float, which is
//     slicing-invariant, is identical on both tiers, and prints the same under any decimal format.
//
//  4. THE C ABI IS THE SAME NUMBERS AND REFUSES THE SAME THINGS. Compiled natively here (EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE
//     degrades to extern "C"), so its validation, its packing and its two capacities run under ctest, ASan
//     and UBSan — the arrangement felitronics_abi_tests uses, and for the same reason.
//
// MUTATION STAND — run on 2026-09-15 against an ISOLATED COPY of the sources (never the shared
// ClipDetector.h, which five branches are reading): **13 of 13 mutants turn this suite red.** The
// mutants were
//   m1  a band closed on the call boundary          m6b the poison does not clear validity
//   m2  the pending queue drained per process()     m7  the shim feeds frames/2
//   m3  every run level rounded through float       m8  the report readable before finish()
//   m4  the chunk loop without its plane offset     m9  the peak copier fills the caller's capacity
//   m5  runsComplete() always true                  m10 the run copier returns doubles, not runs
//   m6  finish() ignores the refusal poison         m11 the three clocks no longer compared
//                                                   m12 the run copier reads `cap` as runs, not doubles
// m3 is the one that matters most: it is slicing-invariant, identical on both tiers and prints the same
// under any decimal format, so every slicing comparison here and the whole parity harness pass it — only the
// pinned bit pattern kills it. m4 and m11 are the two that a test driving the detector instead of the adapter
// could not see at all. m6b, m9 and m12 came from the post-build review rounds, and m12 was a live hazard
// rather than an invented mutation: the entry point took its capacity in RUNS while the other seven copiers
// of that ABI take ELEMENTS.
