// fcore::Probe is the measurement body shared VERBATIM between the native reference CLI and the wasm shim,
// so the whole wasm-spike parity claim rests on it. What that claim needs, and what this suite pins:
//
//   * the TU is genuinely built without FP contraction — the acceptance condition is a compiler flag, and a
//     flag nobody tests is a flag that silently disappears;
//   * the refactor into Probe changed no arithmetic — nulled bit-for-bit against the hand-rolled path the
//     tool used before;
//   * chunking cannot move a bit, at any chunk size, because the wasm side chunks differently from the CLI;
//   * the true-peak CONFIG is pinned, because the core holds a second, different true-peak filter and
//     reaching for it would fail the spike by ~3e-3 dB while looking like a wasm bug;
//   * the adversarial surface (rates, channel counts, degenerate lengths, non-finite samples) behaves the way
//     it is DOCUMENTED to behave, not the way one hopes.
//
// Bit-exact throughout where bit-exactness is the actual claim: test::approx would hide precisely the class
// of defect this suite exists to catch.
