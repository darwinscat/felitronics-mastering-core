// The `clips` stream, formatted — the C++ half of a format whose JavaScript half is tools/wasm/clips-format.mjs.
//
// SEPARATE FROM fcore_clips.h ON PURPOSE. That header is the measurement wiring and is compiled INTO THE WASM
// MODULE; this one is the CLI's text and is not. The wasm side formats in JavaScript, as it does for `blocks`
// and for the shapes, so linking snprintf and a std::string builder into the module would be payload for a
// function it never calls — dead-stripped at -O3, but the checked artifact is built -O1 -g and the module's
// size is an acceptance criterion of its own (tools/wasm/build.sh).

// THE FORMAT. Every floating-point number goes out as a raw IEEE-754 bit pattern — 16 lowercase hex digits —
// and never as decimal or %a: the other side of this comparison is JavaScript, which has no hex-float
// printing and whose decimal formatting is not C's, so a 16-digit pattern is the one representation both
// sides produce identically and `diff` IS the parity test. The same rule and the same reason as
// tools/wasm/blocks-format.mjs. It also makes the comparison sharp: a single flipped bit in a level or a
// peak changes a character here, where "%.17g" would still print it and "%.6f" would hide it entirely.
//
// The sample rate is a bit pattern for the same reason: C's %g and JavaScript's Number-to-string do not
// agree on a fractional rate. The integers are plain decimal — every one of them is bounded by the frame
// count, so it is below 2^32 and prints identically through printf("%lld") and JavaScript's String(Number).
//
// NOTHING IS IN dB. samplePeakDb() is a log10 conversion, and this format carries linear bits instead so
// the diff cannot be broken by one. (The libm audit moved that getter to core::gainToDbDet, which IS bit-identical
// across toolchains — so the original reason has weakened, but the decision stands on its own: a linear
// bit pattern is the measured quantity and a dB column would be a derived one.)
// A report that is not `ok` formats as NOTHING, not as a plausible empty report. readClips() already returns
// false and clears its output, but a caller can forget a bool; it cannot forget an empty stdout, and the
// alternative — printing `runs 0 / complete 1` for a measurement that never happened — is the certificate of
// cleanliness this whole path exists to make impossible.
