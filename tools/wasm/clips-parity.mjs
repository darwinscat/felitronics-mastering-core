// The wasm side of the clipped-runs parity check. Emits EXACTLY what `fcore_measure clips` emits, so
// the test is a diff:
//
//   fcore_measure clips 48000 2 x.f32 --max-runs 500                              > native.txt
//   node clips-parity.mjs build/fcprobe.node.js clips 48000 2 x.f32 --max-runs 500 > wasm.txt
//   diff native.txt wasm.txt
//
// Usage: node clips-parity.mjs <module.js> clips <sampleRate> <channels> <raw.f32le> [--max-runs N] [--chunk N]
//
// `--chunk` IS ACCEPTED AND DELIBERATELY NOT HONOURED HERE, which makes the diff stronger rather than
// sloppier. The module measures the whole buffer in one fc_probe_clips_run call; the native tool cuts the
// stream into process() calls of the requested size. So a diff taken with `--chunk 7` compares a
// seven-sample-at-a-time native run against a one-call wasm run, and law 8a — the report cannot depend on
// where the stream was cut — is then part of what the parity test proves, across two toolchains at once.
// Without this, the two sides would both end up cutting at multiples of fcore::ClipProbe::kChunk and the diff
// would say nothing at all about re-slicing.
//
// The detached-view rule of parity.mjs holds here too: no HEAP view is held across a call into the module,
// and every output is copied out of the heap before the next call.

//
//   · the rate: `parseRate` is strtod plus "the whole string was consumed" (fcore_measure.cpp), which accepts
//     `1e3`, `1000.` and `+1000`. `Number()` accepts exactly those and the same rejections, EXCEPT for
//     JavaScript's own literal forms (`0b1`, `0o7`, `1_0`, `Infinity`) and the empty string, which strtod does
//     not read — so those are refused explicitly rather than left to agree by luck. ONE RESIDUAL, measured:
//     strtod also reads C99 hex floats, so `0x1p13` is a legal 8192 Hz natively and is refused here. It is
//     left refused rather than reimplemented: a spelling nobody types, and a refusal on this side is an
//     exit 2 with no output, which is loud — not the silent divergence the bounds below exist to stop. The
//     same goes for strtod's leading whitespace: `" 48000"` measures natively and is refused here.
//   · the counts: `parseCount` is up to 18 decimal digits and nothing else.
//   · the bounds: the width against core::kMaxChannels, the capacity against fcore::ClipProbe::kMaxRuns, the
//     chunk against the int it is narrowed to. WITHOUT THE CAPACITY BOUND HERE, `--max-runs 4294967296` wraps
//     to 0 on the way into a uint32_t parameter and this side reports a successful run of `maxruns=0` while
//     the native tool exits 2 — a silent disagreement, found by the review round.
