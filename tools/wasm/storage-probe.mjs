// The wasm side of `fc_probe_<mode>_storage_bytes` — the price of a measurement, asked before it is
// paid.
//
//   node storage-probe.mjs build/fcprobe.node.js table    # the same 475 rows the native tier prints
//   node storage-probe.mjs build/fcprobe.node.js check    # the assertions that only this tier can make
//
// WHY A HARNESS OF ITS OWN, WHEN felitronics_analysis_abi_tests ALREADY HAMMERS THESE FUNCTIONS. That
// suite compiles fc_probe.cpp NATIVELY. It cannot see whether a name survived the link into the module,
// and `cmp` cannot detect a function nobody called — an export missing from the artifact would leave
// every native check green and the page holding `undefined`. So:
//
//   `table` prints the demands as the MODULE computes them, for
//           `felitronics_analysis_abi_tests --storage-table` to be compared against. That is a CROSS-TIER
//           oracle: wasm32 is a 32-bit target with its own std::size_t and its own struct layouts, so the
//           two tables agreeing row for row is a statement about the arithmetic and not about one build
//           being compared with itself. Only integer rates are listed, so both sides print "48000" and
//           the diff is of numbers rather than of two printf dialects.
//   `check` asserts what only this tier can: that all five names are callable on the Module at all, and
//           that in THIS tier too the price is positive exactly where `_run` is accepted.
//
// No HEAP view is held across a call into the module. An accepted `_run` may allocate, and `memory.grow`
// inside it DETACHES the ArrayBuffer every existing view was made on. A detached view is not a view onto
// freed memory: its length becomes 0, an indexed read gives `undefined`, an indexed write reaches nothing,
// and `.set()` throws TypeError. That is why every view here is taken AFTER the call and copied out with
// `.slice()` before the next one.
