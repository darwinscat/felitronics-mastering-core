// fc_probe — the wasm spike's C export: the thinnest possible skin over fcore::Probe, which is the SAME
// translation unit the native reference CLI runs (tools/fcore_probe.h). Nothing is measured here; this file
// only unpacks an ABI.
//
// ABI SHAPE. Planar float32, one pointer, channel c at `planar + c*frames`. That satisfies the ratified
// "PCM not files, planar float32 in heap" boundary while avoiding `const float* const*` across the wasm
// boundary — a pointer-to-pointer would mean building a table of i32 offsets in the heap and exporting
// HEAPU32 to write it, for no gain. It also maps 1:1 onto what JS already has: AudioBuffer.getChannelData(c)
// is planar, so the page does one HEAPF32.set() per channel and no de-interleave loop.
//
// `frames` is uint32_t, not int: wasm32 is a 32-bit target and a signed frame count invites an overflow that
// simply cannot happen on the 64-bit machine this core was written and tested on.
//
// WHAT THE PARITY CHECK READS. fc_probe_lufs / fc_probe_dbtp are the two numbers the spike asks for, but neither is
// the comparison surface: the integrated LUFS is discontinuous at the BS.1770 gates and the dB form of the
// true peak is routed through log10. The surface is fc_probe_block_energies() (pre-gate, continuous) plus
// fc_probe_tp_linear(). See tools/fcore_probe.h for why.

// `prepare()`, and there was nothing to ask the price with.
//
// WHY THAT MATTERS HERE AND NOT NATIVELY. This module is built `-fno-exceptions` (tools/wasm/build.sh),
// and there a failed allocation has no way to say no: `std::vector::assign` calls `operator new`, the
// throw is compiled out, and libc++ calls abort(). The C entry point then NEVER RETURNS — a caller
// reading `_fc_probe_hum_run(...) === 1` is not handed a 0, it is handed a thrown exception from a
// function it was reading a status out of.
//
// MEASURED, and measured more narrowly than the first telling of it. With emscripten's linear memory
// squeezed to 1 932 984 320 bytes of its 2 147 483 648 ceiling and a 64-byte input,
// `fc_probe_hum_run (ptr, 1, 16, 768000)` produced, on the checked module, exactly this:
// "Cannot enlarge memory, requested 2 252 435 248 bytes, but the limit is 2 147 483 648" ->
// "bad_alloc was thrown in -fno-exceptions mode" -> "Aborted(native code called abort())". What is NOT
// true, and was assumed before it was checked: the page does not die and the module is not poisoned. The
// WebAssembly.RuntimeError IS catchable in JavaScript, and after catching it the module went on
// answering — the getters of the aborted mode read 0, as the `have*` discipline promises, `_free` worked,
// and a later affordable run at 48 kHz stereo returned 1. That recovery is an observation and not a
// guarantee: abort() does not unwind, so whatever the allocation was half-way through is left where it
// stood. The defect this section closes is therefore the narrow, certain one — A MEASUREMENT THAT CANNOT
// BE PRICED AND CANNOT REFUSE — and not a crash story.
//
// And the prices are not small: `HumDetector::storageFor()` at 768 kHz and 16 channels asks for
// 352 688 184 bytes, the five together for 377 423 824, against a 2 GiB ceiling that also has to hold the
// caller's decoded input.
//
// WHAT THESE FIVE ANSWER, EXACTLY
//
//  * A DEMAND, NOT A FOOTPRINT, AND THE PAYLOAD ONLY. It is the sum of the byte counts the NEXT prepare()
//    at this geometry will pass to `operator new`, on a fresh object. It excludes, deliberately and
//    without apology: allocator metadata and alignment padding, fragmentation, the growth granularity of
//    the wasm heap, THE CALLER'S OWN INPUT BUFFER (frames * channels * 4, which only the caller knows),
//    and whatever the other four analyzers are still holding. It is also not what THIS analyzer is
//    holding: `std::vector::assign` never gives capacity back, so an instance that has already run wider
//    owns more than this number says (BandBursts::Storage spells the same caveat for itself), and one
//    that has already run at THIS geometry asks for nothing at all — except SourceForensics, whose
//    second prepare() at the same geometry asks for 688 144 of its 2 080 152 again. Measured, all of it.
//  * A POSITIVE ANSWER IS NOT A PROMISE. This entry point cannot reserve anything, and it is a number to
//    make a policy with, not an allocation that succeeded. That is also why the number is PUBLISHED here
//    rather than turned into a ceiling: a browser's memory budget is a product decision belonging to the
//    page, not a constant this file gets to invent. What the page is NOT given here is the scale to judge
//    the number against: emscripten's own glue keeps the heap maximum to itself, and while it can be read
//    out of the wasm bytes — tools/wasm/check-no-threads.mjs already parses that memory limit — that is a
//    build-time reading, not something a worker does at run time. If it is ever wanted it is one more fact
//    of module identity beside fc_probe_sizeof_longdouble, and still not a ceiling.
//  * ZERO MEANS THE GEOMETRY IS REFUSED, and it cannot be read as a free measurement — but the reason is
//    STRUCTURAL and not a measured minimum. An accepted geometry always buys something: four of the five
//    size at least one record per INPUT channel, and LowEnd — which does not, its spectrum being sized for
//    two fixed mid/side axes — still buys a band table and a block store. None of the five can be accepted
//    and cost nothing. A grid is only
//    a sample and says nothing about the rest of the domain: the smallest demand a fine sweep of the
//    accepted domain FOUND is 416 792 bytes (report, 8050 Hz, one channel; 158 240 — hum at 1517 Hz — before
//    the rate floor moved to 8 kHz, and the same sweep reproduces that number on the old tree), which is
//    an observation. What
//    the gate pins is the equivalence, not a constant — felitronics_analysis_abi_tests walks a grid of
//    widths and rates, including each mode's own admission floor, and asserts that the query is positive
//    exactly where `_run` is accepted. The zero is a canonical +0.0, which is what lets a caller write
//    `need > 0` and a test write `! signbit`.
//  * NO AUDIO POINTER AND NO FRAME COUNT, on purpose, and NOT the argument list of `_run`. The price has
//    to be askable BEFORE the input buffer exists — that is the whole use — so these entry points neither
//    take nor dereference one, and `_run` keeps its own buffer checks (planarSpan / planarSpanOrEmpty,
//    and lowend's refusal of an empty programme, which is an input contract and not a geometry). What the
//    two roads must agree about is the GEOMETRY, and that is what the gate compares. Nothing is lost by
//    dropping the length: no preparation here is sized by the programme. The one analyzer sized by a
//    duration, ProgrammeReport, is sized by `ProgrammeReportParams::maxDurationSec` — a fixed hour — and a
//    longer programme overflows bounded stores and says so, it does not grow them.
//  * THE SAME PARAMETERS AND THE SAME BLOCK AS THE RUN. Each mode's defaults are one `constexpr` constant
//    read by both roads (kReportParams and its four siblings). `report` is the only one whose storageFor()
//    takes a maxBlock, and it is given `fcore::Probe::kChunk` — the value fc_probe_report_run() hands to
//    prepare(), not the caller's frame count.
//
// `double` AND NOT `std::uint64_t`. Not for the reason this file used to give — see the corrected note
// above fc_probe_clips_runs: i64 does cross this boundary on the pinned toolchain, as a BigInt, and a
// BigInt is the wrong shape for a byte count a page has to add to its own input size and put in a report:
// `bigint + number` throws TypeError and JSON.stringify refuses it, so every use site would have to
// convert it first — which is a conversion, and a place for a conversion to be wrong. Every demand in the
// accepted domain is far below 2^53, so a binary64
// carries it exactly; a `std::uint32_t` would arrive in JavaScript through a signed i32 and read negative
// for anything past 2^31, which the 2 GiB ceiling makes reachable in principle.
//
// THE NAME. `_storage_bytes` and not `_need`, which is what the sibling ABI calls the same idea
// (fc_master_need, DSP-ARCHITECTURE.md §law 11d): this side of the tree speaks `Storage` / `storageFor`,
// and the export is named after the function whose number it is carrying.
