// fcore::Probe — the measurement body shared VERBATIM by the native reference CLI (tools/fcore_measure.cpp)
// and the wasm shim (tools/wasm/fc_probe.cpp), so that the wasm spike's claim — "the same code, the same
// doubles" — is a fact about one translation unit rather than a hope about two.
//
// Sharing the source removes ONE variable. It does not by itself make the two sides agree: different
// compilers (Apple clang vs the emscripten upstream), different libm, and different FP-contraction defaults
// still sit between this source and the doubles it produces. What closes the gap is the build contract:
//
//   * the native side MUST be compiled -ffp-contract=off. Baseline wasm has no scalar FMA instruction, so
//     emscripten cannot contract; a contracting native build differs. Measured on real audio: the true-peak
//     answer moves 6.75e-7 dB (exactly 1 float ulp in the polyphase accumulator) between contract=on and off.
//   * the wasm side MUST NOT be built -mrelaxed-simd. f64x2.relaxed_madd is implementation-defined (fused on
//     hosts with FMA, unfused elsewhere), which breaks determinism between MACHINES, not merely between
//     tiers. Plain -msimd128 lowers to f64x2.mul/add and is safe.
//
// WHAT TO COMPARE. Not the integrated LUFS: it is DISCONTINUOUS in its inputs, because the BS.1770 gates are
// strict comparisons — a 400 ms block sitting within ~1e-12 of a gate flips its inclusion between two builds
// and moves the reading by ~0.01 dB, seven orders above any sane tolerance. Compare gatingBlockEnergies():
// the pre-gate block energies are continuous in the input samples and can carry a bit-exactness claim. The
// true-peak LINEAR maximum is likewise continuous (a 1-ulp input moves a max by at most 1 ulp) and is
// compared directly; its dB form is derived once at the end and is for humans.
//
// TRUE-PEAK CONFIG IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, AND IT LIVES IN ONE CLASS. The core holds two different true-peak
// filters: analysis::ReferenceTruePeakMeter (PolyphaseOversampler at 4x, 32 taps/phase = a 128-tap prototype,
// cutoff 0.90x Nyquist, Kaiser beta 9, at every rate) and analysis::TruePeakMeter (the spec's 12 taps/phase,
// full base Nyquist, beta 8, factor chosen by rate). They read different numbers — how far apart is measured
// and pinned by felitronics_truepeak_instrument_gap_tests, not written here. This probe is the REFERENCE: it
// measures through ReferenceTruePeakMeter, which is also what TargetLoudnessSolver aims a delivered ceiling
// with, so the file a solve delivers and the number this tool prints for it come from the same arithmetic. A
// shim that reached for the "obvious" TruePeakMeter would disagree with both, and the failure would read as a
// wasm bug. Both sides go through THIS class.
